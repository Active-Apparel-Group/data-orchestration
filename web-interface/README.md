## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

```
GET  /                          - Health check
GET  /api/boards               - Get accessible Monday.com boards
POST /api/upload/analyze       - Analyze uploaded file
POST /api/mapping/suggest      - Get intelligent column mapping suggestions
POST /api/upload/start         - Start async upload process
GET  /api/upload/{id}/progress - Get real-time upload progress
GET  /api/upload/{id}/results  - Get final upload results with Monday.com item IDs
```

### Data Flow Architecture

```
1. File Upload → FileParserService → Column Detection & Analysis
2. Board Selection → MondayWrapperService → Board Schema Fetch
3. Column Mapping → ColumnMapperService → Intelligent Mapping Suggestions
4. Upload Process → UploadManagerService → Batch Processing with Progress Tracking
5. Results & Export → Monday.com Item IDs + Export Data Generation
```

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

The web interface leverages existing production systems:
- **AsyncBatchMondayUpdater**: For high-performance batch uploads
- **Rate Limiting Systems**: Production-proven API rate management
- **GraphQL Infrastructure**: Existing Monday.com API wrappers
- **Logging Systems**: Integration with existing logger_helper utilities

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ with FastAPI, uvicorn, pandas, openpyxl
- Node.js 16+ for React frontend
- Access to existing Monday.com GraphQL infrastructure

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd web-interface/backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart pandas openpyxl
python test_server.py  # Test server on http://localhost:8000
```

### Frontend Setup (Coming Next)
```bash
cd web-interface/frontend
npm install
npm start  # React dev server on http://localhost:3000
```
