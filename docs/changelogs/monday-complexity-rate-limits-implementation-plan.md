## 💻 Code Implementation Examples

### Before: Basic GraphQL Query
```graphql
# Original query without complexity monitoring
query GetItemsAndSubitems {
  boards(ids: 9200517329) {
    items_page(query_params: {ids: [9218090006]}) {
      items {
        id
        name
        subitems {
          id
          name
          column_values {
            id
            value
            text
            column {
              title
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### After: Complexity-Aware Query
```graphql
# Enhanced query with automatic complexity monitoring
query GetItemsAndSubitems {
  complexity {
    before
    query
    after
    reset_in_x_seconds
  }
  boards(ids: 9200517329) {
    items_page(query_params: {ids: [9218090006]}) {
      items {
        id
        name
        subitems {
          id
          name
          column_values {
            id
            value
            text
            column {
              title
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Complexity Manager Usage
```python
# Initialize complexity manager
from pipelines.utils.complexity_manager import create_complexity_manager

complexity_manager = create_complexity_manager(logger)

# Automatic query enhancement
original_query = """
mutation UpdateItem($itemId: ID!, $columnValues: JSON!) {
  change_multiple_column_values(
    item_id: $itemId,
    column_values: $columnValues
  ) {
    id
    updated_at
  }
}
"""

# Manager automatically adds complexity monitoring
enhanced_query = complexity_manager.add_complexity_to_query(original_query)

# Execute with automatic retry and budget management
response = await complexity_manager.execute_with_complexity_management(
    request_func=execute_graphql_request,
    query=original_query,
    max_retries=3
)
```

### Dynamic Batch Configuration
```python
# Get optimal configuration based on current budget
config = complexity_manager.get_dynamic_batch_configuration()

# Results in adaptive behavior:
# Budget > 80%: batch_size=15, concurrency=3
# Budget 50-80%: batch_size=7, concurrency=2  
# Budget 20-50%: batch_size=5, concurrency=1
# Budget < 20%: batch_size=1, concurrency=1

print(f"Optimal batch size: {config['batch_size']}")
print(f"Optimal concurrency: {config['concurrency']}")
print(f"Current budget: {config['budget_percentage']:.1f}%")
```

### Error Handling Example
```python
# Automatic 429 error handling
try:
    response = await execute_graphql_with_complexity(session, query)
except ComplexityBudgetExhausted as e:
    # Manager automatically handles:
    # 1. Extract retry_in_seconds from API response
    # 2. Log complexity usage details
    # 3. Wait appropriate time
    # 4. Retry with smaller batch size
    
    action = complexity_manager.handle_complexity_error(e.error_data)
    await asyncio.sleep(action['wait_time'])
    # Automatic retry with reduced batch size
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Patterns

### 1. Query Enhancement Pattern
```python
class MondayAPIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.complexity_manager = create_complexity_manager()
    
    async def execute_query(self, query: str, variables: dict = None):
        """Execute query with automatic complexity management"""
        return await self.complexity_manager.execute_with_complexity_management(
            request_func=self._make_request,
            query=query,
            variables=variables
        )
    
    async def _make_request(self, enhanced_query: str, **kwargs):
        """Internal request method that receives enhanced query"""
        # Manager has already added complexity monitoring
        payload = {"query": enhanced_query}
        if kwargs.get('variables'):
            payload["variables"] = kwargs['variables']
        
        async with self.session.post(self.api_url, json=payload) as response:
            return await response.json()
```

### 2. Batch Processing Pattern
```python
async def process_large_dataset(self, records: List[dict]):
    """Process large datasets with adaptive batch sizing"""
    
    processed = 0
    errors = []
    
    while processed < len(records):
        # Get current optimal configuration
        config = self.complexity_manager.get_dynamic_batch_configuration()
        
        # Check budget before processing
        budget_check = self.complexity_manager.can_execute_request()
        if not budget_check['can_execute']:
            wait_time = budget_check['recommended_delay']
            self.logger.info(f"Budget insufficient, waiting {wait_time}s")
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
            continue
        
        # Process batch with current configuration
        batch_size = config['batch_size']
        batch = records[processed:processed + batch_size]
        
        try:
            result = await self.process_batch(batch)
            processed += len(batch)
            
            # Apply recommended delay
            await asyncio.sleep(budget_check['recommended_delay'])
            
        except ComplexityBudgetExhausted:
            # Manager handles retry automatically
            continue
```

### 3. Monitoring Pattern
```python
def log_complexity_metrics(self):
    """Log complexity usage metrics for monitoring"""
    
    if self.complexity_manager.complexity_history:
        recent = self.complexity_manager.complexity_history[-10:]  # Last 10 requests
        
        avg_complexity = sum(h['query_cost'] for h in recent) / len(recent)
        total_used = sum(h['query_cost'] for h in recent)
        
        self.logger.info(f"[METRICS] Average query complexity: {avg_complexity:,.0f}")
        self.logger.info(f"[METRICS] Total complexity used (last 10): {total_used:,}")
        self.logger.info(f"[METRICS] Current budget: {self.complexity_manager.current_budget:,}")
        self.logger.info(f"[METRICS] Budget utilization: {((10_000_000 - self.complexity_manager.current_budget) / 10_000_000 * 100):.1f}%")
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```python
# Test complexity manager functionality
def test_complexity_injection():
    manager = create_complexity_manager()
    
    original = "query { boards { id } }"
    enhanced = manager.add_complexity_to_query(original)
    
    assert "complexity {" in enhanced
    assert "before" in enhanced
    assert "after" in enhanced

def test_budget_checking():
    manager = create_complexity_manager()
    manager.current_budget = 500_000  # Set low budget
    
    check = manager.can_execute_request(estimated_complexity=1_000_000)
    
    assert check['can_execute'] == False
    assert check['recommended_delay'] > 0
```

### Integration Tests
```python
async def test_batch_processing_with_complexity():
    """Test full batch processing with complexity management"""
    
    updater = AsyncBatchMondayUpdaterV2(
        config_file="test_config.toml",
        max_concurrent_batches=1  # Reduced for testing
    )
    
    # Test with simulated data
    test_data = create_test_dataframe(100)  # 100 test records
    
    result = await updater.async_batch_update_with_complexity_management(
        query="SELECT * FROM test_table",
        update_config=test_config,
        dry_run=True
    )
    
    assert result['success'] == True
    assert result['total_records'] == 100
    assert 'complexity_info' in result
```

### Performance Tests
```python
async def test_large_dataset_performance():
    """Test performance with large datasets"""
    
    # Simulate 1000 record processing
    start_time = time.time()
    
    result = await process_test_dataset(size=1000)
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    throughput = result['items_updated'] / duration
    
    # Assert performance targets
    assert throughput >= 5.0  # Minimum 5 items/second
    assert result['success_rate'] >= 95.0  # 95% success rate
    assert duration <= 300  # Maximum 5 minutes for 1000 items
```

## 📚 Developer Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Always Use Complexity Manager**: Never make direct Monday.com API calls
2. **Monitor Budget Usage**: Check complexity metrics in logs regularly
3. **Implement Graceful Degradation**: Reduce batch sizes when budget is low
4. **Test with Real Data**: Use actual Monday.com data for performance testing
5. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: Use 25-second timeouts to avoid 30-second API limit

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Uses complexity manager for all Monday.com API calls
- [ ] Implements proper error handling for 429 responses
- [ ] Includes complexity monitoring in GraphQL queries
- [ ] Uses dynamic batch sizing based on budget status
- [ ] Has appropriate logging for complexity usage
- [ ] Includes unit tests for complexity scenarios

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Direct API call without complexity management
response = requests.post(monday_api_url, json={"query": query})

# ✅ CORRECT: Use complexity manager
response = await complexity_manager.execute_with_complexity_management(
    request_func=api_client.execute,
    query=query
)

# ❌ WRONG: Fixed batch sizes
batch_size = 15  # Always use 15 items

# ✅ CORRECT: Dynamic batch sizing
batch_size = complexity_manager.get_optimal_batch_size(base_batch_size=15)

# ❌ WRONG: No retry on 429 errors
if response.status_code == 429:
    raise Exception("Rate limited")

# ✅ CORRECT: Intelligent retry with complexity awareness
# (Handled automatically by complexity manager)
```
