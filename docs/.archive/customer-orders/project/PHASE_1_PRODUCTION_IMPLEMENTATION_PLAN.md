# Phase 1 Production Implementation Plan
**Customer Orders Pipeline - GREYSON PO 4755 Subitem Integration**

**Status:** EXECUTION READY  
**Priority:** P0 - Critical Production Blocker  
**Target:** 24-hour implementation cycle  
**Success Metric:** 264 subitems successfully created in Monday.com

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

**Problem:** Subitems are not being created in staging table (`STG_MON_CustMasterSchedule_Subitems`) due to overly complex change detection logic with triple redundancy.

**Root Cause:** 
- `ChangeDetector` class provides redundant functionality
- `CustomerBatchProcessor` has its own change detection (redundant)
- `main_customer_orders.py` also performs change detection (triple redundancy!)
- Batch marked as `COMPLETED` before subitems are processed

**Solution:** Eliminate redundancy, simplify to direct comparison, fix processing sequence.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 1: NEW Orders Production (24 Hours)

### Success Criteria
- âœ… **STG_MON_CustMasterSchedule_Subitems** has 264 records for GREYSON PO 4755
- âœ… **Monday.com Board 4755559751** shows 264 subitems with correct size data
- âœ… **No dependency** on `ORDERS_UNIFIED_SNAPSHOT` table
- âœ… **End-to-end test** passes with quantitative validation

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Remove Change Detection Redundancy (30 min)
**File:** `dev/customer-orders/change_detector.py`
**Action:** Mark for removal (keep temporarily for reference)
**Reason:** Triple redundancy with CustomerBatchProcessor

#### Step 2: Simplify CustomerBatchProcessor (1 hour)
**File:** `dev/customer-orders/customer_batch_processor.py`
**Method:** `get_customer_changes()`

**Current (Complex):**
```python
# Triple change detection with SNAPSHOT table
LEFT JOIN ORDERS_UNIFIED_SNAPSHOT
```

**New (Simple):**
```python
# Direct comparison for NEW orders only
SELECT ou.*
FROM [dbo].[ORDERS_UNIFIED] ou
LEFT JOIN [dbo].[MON_CustMasterSchedule] mc
    ON ou.[AAG ORDER NUMBER] = mc.[AAG ORDER NUMBER]
WHERE ou.[CUSTOMER NAME] LIKE '%GREYSON%'
    AND ou.[PO NUMBER] = '4755'
    AND mc.[AAG ORDER NUMBER] IS NULL  -- NEW orders only
```

#### Step 3: Fix Subitem Processing Sequence (30 min)
**File:** `dev/customer-orders/customer_batch_processor.py`
**Method:** `_process_subitems()`

**Issue:** Batch marked `COMPLETED` before subitems processed
**Fix:** Separate batch completion states:
- `ITEMS_COMPLETED` - Main records done
- `SUBITEMS_COMPLETED` - Subitem records done  
- `BATCH_COMPLETED` - Both items AND subitems done

#### Step 4: End-to-End Validation (1 hour)
**Test:** `python tests/end_to_end/test_greyson_po_4755_complete_workflow.py`
**Target:** All phases pass with 264 subitems created

## ðŸš€ Implementation Sequence

### Immediate Actions (Next 3 Hours)

**Hour 1: Code Changes**
```powershell
# 1. Backup current working state
git checkout -b phase_1_production_implementation

# 2. Modify CustomerBatchProcessor
# - Update get_customer_changes() method
# - Fix _process_subitems() sequence

python tests/debug/test_direct_subitem_creation.py
```

**Hour 2: Testing & Validation**
```powershell
# 1. Run simplified test
python main_customer_orders.py --customer GREYSON --po-number 4755 --mode TEST

# 2. Check staging table
# Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STG_MON_CustMasterSchedule_Subitems

# 3. Validate Monday.com API
# Check board 4755559751 for subitems
```

**Hour 3: Production Deployment**
```powershell
# 1. Full end-to-end test
python tests/end_to_end/test_greyson_po_4755_complete_workflow.py

# 2. Deploy to production
git merge main
```

## ðŸ“Š Detailed Technical Changes

### CustomerBatchProcessor Simplification

**Before (Complex):**
```python
def get_customer_changes(self, customer_name: str, limit: Optional[int] = None, po_number_filter: Optional[str] = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Complex logic with multiple joins, snapshot comparison, UUID tracking
    # 50+ lines of code with 3 different change detection methods
```

**After (Simple):**
```python
def get_customer_changes(self, customer_name: str, limit: Optional[int] = None, po_number_filter: Optional[str] = None) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Direct query for NEW orders - Phase 1 implementation"""
    
    query = """
    SELECT TOP {limit} *
    FROM [dbo].[ORDERS_UNIFIED] ou
    LEFT JOIN [dbo].[MON_CustMasterSchedule] mc
        ON ou.[AAG ORDER NUMBER] = mc.[AAG ORDER NUMBER]
    WHERE ou.[CUSTOMER NAME] LIKE ?
        AND ou.[PO NUMBER] = ?
        AND mc.[AAG ORDER NUMBER] IS NULL  -- NEW orders only
    ORDER BY ou.[ORDER DATE PO RECEIVED] DESC
    """.format(limit=limit or 10000)
    
    with db.get_connection('orders') as conn:
        return pd.read_sql(query, conn, params=[f'%{customer_name}%', po_number_filter])
```

### Batch Completion Logic Fix

**Current Issue:**
```python
# Batch marked COMPLETED after items, blocking subitems
batch_status = 'COMPLETED'  # TOO EARLY!
```

**Fixed Logic:**
```python
# Separate completion tracking
def update_batch_status(self, batch_id: str, stage: str):
    if stage == 'ITEMS':
        # Update: items_creation_completed = 1
    elif stage == 'SUBITEMS':
        # Update: subitems_creation_completed = 1
    
    # Only mark COMPLETED when BOTH items AND subitems done
    if items_done and subitems_done:
        batch_status = 'COMPLETED'
```
