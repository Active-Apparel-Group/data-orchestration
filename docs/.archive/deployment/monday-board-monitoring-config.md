# Monday.com Board Monitoring & Alerting Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the monitoring and alerting configuration for Monday.com board extraction workflows deployed to Kestra.

## Current Deployed Boards

### Customer Master Schedule (Board ID: 9200517329)
- **Workflow ID**: `monday-board-customer_master_schedule`
- **Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM
- **Status**: Production Ready âœ…
- **Deployed**: 2025-06-18

## Monitoring Configuration

### 1. Kestra Built-in Monitoring
Each workflow includes:
- **Performance Metrics Logging**: Execution time, status, and run ID tracking
- **Error Handling**: Automated error notifications with context
- **Completion Logging**: Success confirmations with timestamp

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Expected Performance Benchmarks
- **API Fetch Rate**: ~250 records per 15-20 seconds
- **Data Processing**: ~500 records per second  
- **Database Insert**: ~1000 records per 4-5 seconds
- **Total Execution Time**: <3 minutes per 1000 records
- **Max Acceptable Runtime**: 10 minutes

#### Success Criteria
- **Data Completeness**: All expected columns extracted
- **Zero Data Loss**: Atomic swap operations successful
- **Error Rate**: <5% acceptable threshold
- **Schedule Adherence**: Executions start within 5 minutes of scheduled time

### 3. Alert Conditions

#### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
1. **Execution Failure**: Workflow state = FAILED
2. **Execution Timeout**: Runtime > 10 minutes
3. **Zero Records Processed**: Indicates API connectivity issues
4. **Database Connection Failure**: Target table not accessible

#### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
1. **Performance Degradation**: Runtime > 5 minutes but < 10 minutes
2. **Partial Data Retrieval**: Record count significantly lower than expected
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Extended retry cycles detected

#### Information Alerts (Logging Only)
1. **Successful Completion**: Normal execution with metrics
2. **Schema Changes Detected**: Dynamic schema adaptation triggered
3. **Scheduled Maintenance**: Manual execution during maintenance windows

## Alert Destinations

### Development Team Notifications
- **Primary Contact**: Development Team Lead
- **Secondary Contact**: Data Engineering Team
- **Escalation**: DevOps On-Call Engineer (for critical failures)

### Notification Methods
1. **Kestra Dashboard**: Real-time status monitoring
2. **Execution Logs**: Detailed performance and error logging
3. **Future Enhancement**: Email/Slack integration for critical alerts
