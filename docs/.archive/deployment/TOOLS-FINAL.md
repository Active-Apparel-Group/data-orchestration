# 🔧 Kestra Deployment Tools - Final Clean Version

## ✅ **TOOLS INVENTORY (3 Essential Tools)**

After extensive testing and cleanup, we now have **3 simple, working tools** that handle all deployment needs.

### 📁 **Current Tools:**
```
tools/
├── deploy-scripts-clean.ps1  🐍 Deploy Python scripts to namespace
├── deploy-workflows.ps1      📋 Deploy YAML workflows  
└── build.ps1                🐳 Docker container management
```

---

## 🐍 **deploy-scripts-clean.ps1**

**Purpose**: Upload Python scripts from `scripts/` folder to Kestra namespace `/scripts/`

### **Usage:**
```powershell
.\tools\deploy-scripts-clean.ps1
```

### **What it does:**
✅ **Filters out unwanted files**: `__pycache__/`, `__init__.py`, `*.pyc`  
✅ **Preserves folder structure**: `scripts/audit_pipeline/` → `/scripts/audit_pipeline/`  
✅ **Shows what's uploaded**: Lists all files being deployed  
✅ **Clean output**: Clear success/error messages

### **Core Command:**
```powershell
# Upload ONLY the scripts folder to namespace (preserving folder structure)
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/workspace" -w "/workspace" --network host `
    kestra/kestra:latest `
    namespace files update company.team scripts_clean scripts `
    --server http://localhost:8080
```

### **Example Output:**
```
Deploying Scripts to Kestra
Target: http://localhost:8080 | Namespace: company.team
Filtering out __pycache__ and __init__.py files...
Found 7 files to upload:
  test_sql_enhanced.py
  test_sql_with_env.py
  config.py
  etl.py
  [...]
SUCCESS: Scripts deployed!
```

## 📋 **deploy-workflows.ps1**

**Purpose**: Deploy YAML workflows to Kestra via REST API

### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Deploy all workflows
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 deploy-all

# Deploy specific workflow
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 deploy-single test-sql-with-variables.yml

# List deployed workflows
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 list

# Validate workflows
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 validate

# Delete workflow
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 delete workflow-name
```

### **What it does:**
✅ **REST API deployment**: Uses Kestra's HTTP API  
✅ **Batch operations**: Deploy all workflows at once  
✅ **Validation**: Check workflow syntax before deploy  
✅ **Management**: List, delete existing workflows

---

## 🐳 **build.ps1**

**Purpose**: Docker container management for Kestra

### **Usage:**
```powershell
# Build and start
.\tools\build.ps1 rebuild

# Show logs
.\tools\build.ps1 logs

# Stop containers
.\tools\build.ps1 down

# Clean everything
.\tools\build.ps1 clean
```

### **What it does:**
✅ **Container lifecycle**: Build, start, stop, clean  
✅ **Log management**: View container logs  
✅ **Development workflow**: Quick rebuild cycles

## 🗑️ **CLEANED UP (Removed Tools)**

We removed **9 redundant/broken tools** to keep only what works:

### **Removed:**
- `deploy-scripts.ps1` ❌ (Syntax errors)
- `deploy-scripts-simple.ps1` ❌ (Encoding issues) 
- `kestra-helper.ps1` ❌ (Complex, broken)
- `kestra-cli.ps1` ❌ (Wrapper not needed)
- `simple-deployment-test.ps1` ❌ (Errors, functionality replaced)
- `test-deploy.ps1` ❌ (Experimental)
- `test-deployment-methods.ps1` ❌ (Experimental)
- `test-kestra-deploy.ps1` ❌ (Experimental)
- `working-deployment-methods.ps1` ❌ (Experimental)
- `deployment-methods-summary.ps1` ❌ (Info moved to docs)

### **Why removed:**
- **Syntax errors**: PowerShell parsing issues with complex scripts
- **Over-engineering**: Simple Docker commands work better than complex wrappers
- **Redundancy**: Multiple tools doing the same thing
- **Experimental phase complete**: Development tools no longer needed

---

## 🎯 **DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Simplicity Wins**
- ✅ **Simple Docker commands** work better than complex wrappers
- ✅ **Direct PowerShell** better than over-engineered functions
- ✅ **Clear output** better than verbose logging

### **2. Single Responsibility**
- ✅ **One tool, one job**: Scripts deploy scripts, workflows deploy workflows
- ✅ **No feature creep**: Each tool does exactly what its name says
- ✅ **Easy to understand**: New team members can use immediately

### **3. Reliable & Tested**
- ✅ **All tools work**: No syntax errors or broken functionality
- ✅ **Proven patterns**: Based on commands that already work
- ✅ **Error handling**: Clear success/failure messages

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Complete Deployment Process:**
```powershell
# 1. Deploy Python scripts to namespace
.\tools\deploy-scripts-clean.ps1

# 2. Deploy YAML workflows
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 deploy-all

# 3. Verify deployment
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 list
```

### **Development Workflow:**
```powershell
# Start/restart Kestra
.\tools\build.ps1 rebuild

# Deploy your changes
.\tools\deploy-scripts-clean.ps1
.\tools\deploy-workflows.ps1 deploy-single my-workflow.yml

# Check logs if needed
.\tools\build.ps1 logs
```
