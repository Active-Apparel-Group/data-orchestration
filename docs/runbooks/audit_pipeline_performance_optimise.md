# Performance Optimization Analysis

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Exact Match Function
**Current Issues:**
- Cross-field exact matching uses nested loops (O(n*m) complexity)
- Individual record matching for each unmatched item
- Complex field determination logic for each record
- Row-by-row apply function for score calculation

**V01 Performance:**
- Simple vectorized merge operation
- Single matching key approach
- Minimal post-processing

### 2. Fuzzy Match Function  
**Current Issues:**
- Creates 4 similarity matrices instead of 2:
  - po_to_po_sim
  - po_to_alt_po_sim  
  - alt_po_to_po_sim
  - alt_po_to_alt_po_sim
- Complex matching logic for each record
- Additional score calculations

**V01 Performance:**
- Only 2 similarity matrices (po_sim, alt_po_sim)
- Simpler best match selection
- Fewer calculations per record

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Optimize Exact Matching ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Lookup Dictionary Approach**: Replace nested loops with indexed lookups
2. **Vectorized Score Calculation**: Replace apply() functions with vectorized operations
3. **Reduced Complexity**: From O(n*m) to O(n) for cross-field matching

**Changes Made:**
- Created order_lookup dictionary grouped by customer
- Eliminated row-by-row apply() function for score determination
- Used vectorized string comparison for standard exact matches
- Preserved all enhanced functionality (cross-field matching, proper scoring)

### Phase 2: Optimize Fuzzy Matching ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Single Matrix Approach**: Combine 4 matrices into 1 efficient calculation
2. **Simplified Logic**: Reduce complexity while maintaining cross-field support
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce memory usage by 75%

**Changes Made:**
- Combined all PO fields into single lists for unified similarity calculation
- Reduced from 4 matrices to 1 combined matrix operation
- Simplified index conversion logic for determining best matches
- Maintained all scoring accuracy and field determination

### Phase 3: Maintain Enhanced Features ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Cross-field PO matching capability**: ✅ Preserved
2. **Accurate scoring (PO_Match_Score, Alt_PO_Match_Score)**: ✅ Preserved
3. **Best_Match_Field logic**: ✅ Preserved
4. **Customer_Alt_PO preservation**: ✅ Preserved
