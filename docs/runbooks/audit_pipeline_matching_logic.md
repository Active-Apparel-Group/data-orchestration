# Matching Logic Review Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Cross-Field PO Matching**
**Problem**: The system wasn't attempting to match both Customer_PO and Customer_Alt_PO against both order PO fields.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `fuzzy_match()` function to create cross-field similarity matrices:
  - unmatched PO vs orders PO
  - unmatched PO vs orders Alt_PO  
  - unmatched Alt_PO vs orders PO
  - unmatched Alt_PO vs orders Alt_PO
- Added `create_alternate_matching_keys()` function for better exact matching
- Enhanced `exact_match()` function to perform cross-field exact matching

### 2. **PO Match Scores**
**Problem**: PO_Match_Score and Alt_PO_Match_Score were not being set properly for exact matches.

**Solution**:
- **EXACT matches**: Set scores to 100 for matching field, 0 for non-matching
- **FUZZY matches**: Calculate actual similarity scores using rapidfuzz
- **NO_MATCH**: Set to actual calculated scores even when below threshold

### 3. **Best_Match_Field Logic**
**Problem**: Best_Match_Field was not being set correctly for PO matches.

**Solution**:
- For **exact matches**: Determine field based on which PO actually matched
- For **fuzzy matches**: Set to the field with the highest cross-field match score
- Prefer 'PO' over 'Alt_PO' when both fields have equal scores

### 4. **Group_PO Calculation**
**Problem**: Group_PO should use the best matching PO for quantity variance calculations.

**Solution**:
- Group_PO is set based on Best_Match_Field:
  - If Best_Match_Field == 'Alt_PO': use Best_Match_Alt_PO
  - Otherwise: use Best_Match_PO
- Quantity variance calculations now properly group by the correct PO field

### 5. **Customer_Alt_PO Output**
**Problem**: Customer_Alt_PO was appearing blank in output tabs.

**Solution**:
- Added debugging logs to track Customer_Alt_PO preservation through the pipeline
- Ensured Customer_Alt_PO is properly preserved in:
  - Aggregation step
  - Exact matching results
  - Fuzzy matching results
  - Final output

## Technical Changes Made

### New Functions Added:
1. `create_alternate_matching_keys()` - Creates separate keys for cross-field exact matching
2. Enhanced logging in `match_records()` for debugging

### Enhanced Functions:
1. **`exact_match()`**:
   - Added cross-field exact matching logic
   - Proper PO field determination and scoring
   - Better handling of Best_Match_Field

2. **`fuzzy_match()`**:
   - Complete cross-field similarity matrix calculation
   - Enhanced scoring logic for all PO field combinations
   - Better determination of best match field

3. **`match_records()`**:
   - Added comprehensive debugging logs
   - Statistics tracking for match field distributions
   - Customer_Alt_PO preservation monitoring

### Data Quality Improvements:
- Group_PO logic ensures variance calculations use the correct matched PO
- Match scores are now numeric and properly reflect match quality
- Best_Match_Field accurately represents which field was used for matching

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Both PO fields are now attempted for matching** against both order PO fields
2. **Best_Match_PO and Best_Match_Alt_PO** are properly populated from matched orders
3. **PO_Match_Score and Alt_PO_Match_Score** are numeric with:
   - EXACT matches = 100 for matching field
   - FUZZY matches = actual similarity score (0-100)
   - NO_MATCH = highest calculated score even if below threshold
4. **Best_Match_Field** correctly indicates 'PO' or 'Alt_PO' based on best match
5. **Group_PO** uses the best matched PO for quantity variance calculations
6. **Customer_Alt_PO** is preserved throughout the pipeline and appears in output

## Debugging Features Added

- Input data PO field count logging
- Match field distribution statistics
- Customer_Alt_PO preservation tracking
- PO match score distribution statistics

This comprehensive review ensures the matching logic now properly handles both PO fields, provides accurate scoring, and maintains data integrity throughout the matching pipeline.
