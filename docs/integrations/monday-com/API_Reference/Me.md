# Me

Learn how to use API tokens to read user data through the platform API

All monday.com users have a unique set of user details and different roles within an account. These details are available to access via the API by querying the me object.

# Queries

Required scope: me:read

- Returns an object containing metadata about the user whose API key is being used
- Can only be queried directly at the root

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  me {
    is_guest
    created_at
    name
    id
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { me { is_guest created_at name id}}";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```
