# Boards

Learn how to read, update, create, and delete monday boards using the platform API

monday.com boards are where users input all of their data, making them one of the core platform components. The board's structure consists of items (rows), groups (groups of rows), and columns , and the board's data is stored in items and their respective updates sections.

# Queries

Required scope: boards:read

- Returns an array containing metadata about one or a collection of boards
- Can be queried directly at the root or nest within another query. If you want to retrieve all items on a board, you can use the items_page field in your board query.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  boards (ids: 1234567890) {
    name
    state
    permissions
    items_page {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = 'query { boards (ids: 1234567890) { name state permissions items_page { items { id name }}}}';

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     'query' : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

## Duplicate a board

The duplicate_board mutation allows you to duplicate a board with all of its items and groups to a specific workspace or folder of your choice via the API.
