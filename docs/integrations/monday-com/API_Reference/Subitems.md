# Subitems

Learn how to query subitems on monday boards using the platform API

Subitems are special items that are "nested" under the items on your board. They can be accessed via the subitem column, which can be added from the column's center or by right-clicking an item to expose its dropdown menu. Like items , subitems store data within their columns.

## Queries

Required scope: boards:read

- Returns an array containing metadata about one or a collection of subitems
- Can only be nested within another query

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  items (ids: 1234567890) {
    subitems {
      id
      column_values {
        value
        text
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query {items (ids: 1234567890) { subitems  { id column_values { value text } } } } ";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     'query': query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

# Mutations

Required scope: boards:write

## Create a subitem

The create_subitem mutation allows you to create a new subitem via the API. You can also specify what fields to query back from the new subitem when you run the mutation.

The data of each subitem is stored in the subitem board columns (same as items), each of which holds a particular piece of information. Each column has a specific type, and different column types expect a different set of parameters to update their values. When sending data to a particular column, use a JSON-formatted string. If you're using Javascript, you can use JSON.stringify() to convert a JSON object into a string.

You can also use simple values in this mutation or combine them with regular values. Read more about sending data for each column in our column types reference .

GraphQLJavaScript
```
mutation {
  create_subitem (parent_item_id: 1234567890, item_name: "New subitem", column_values: "{\"date0\":\"2023-05-25\"}") {
    id
    board {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "mutation{ create_subitem (parent_item_id: 1234567890, item_name: \"New subitem\", column_values: \"{\\\"date0\\\":\\\"2023-05-25\\\"}\") { id board { id }}}";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

### Arguments

You can use the following argument(s) to define the new subitem's characteristics.

Argument | Description
--- | ---
column_valuesJSON | The column values of the new subitem.
create_labels_if_missingBoolean | Creates status/dropdown labels if they're missing. Requires permission to change the board structure.
item_nameString! | The new subitem's name.
parent_item_idID! | The parent item's unique identifier.
