Learn how to query an update's viewers using the platform API

Updates contain notes and information added to items outside of their columns. They allow users to organize communication across their organization and respond asynchronously. Many users rely on the updates section as their primary form of communication within the platform.

Users can do things like react and reply to updates, attach files, pin them to the top, and see who has viewed an update. You can use the viewers endpoint to query an update's viewers.

# Queries

Required scope: updates:read

- Returns an array containing metadata about one or a collection of an update's viewers
- Must be nested within an updates query

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  updates {
    viewers {
      user_id
      medium
      user {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { updates { viewers { user_id medium user { name }}}}";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-Version' : '2025-01'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```
