Learn how to read the button column on a monday board using the platform API

The button column allows you to perform an action (i.e., move an item to a new group) with just the click of a button. You can read the button column via the API, but you currently cannot filter, update, or clear it.

## Read the button column

You can query the button column using the column_values object that enables you to return column-specific subfields by sending a fragment in your query.  Values for the button column are of the ButtonValue type.

GraphQL
```
query {
  items (ids:[1234567890, 9876543210]) {
    column_values {
      ... on ButtonValue {
        color
        label
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
colorString | The button's HEX color value.
columnColumn! | The column the value belongs to.
idID! | The button column's unique identifier.
labelString! | The button's label.
textString | The button's text.
typeColumnType! | The column's type.
valueJSON | The column's JSON-formatted raw value.
