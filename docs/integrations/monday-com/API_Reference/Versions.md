Learn how to access all supported API versions using the monday.com platform API

At monday.com, we support multiple API versions to provide users with stability while still allowing us to continuously make improvements. You can find a list of current versions here , or you query the versions endpoint.

## ðŸš§Only want data about the specific version used in a request?

Query the version endpoint instead!

# Queries

- Returns an array containing metadata about all available API versions
- Can only be queried directly at the root

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  versions {
    kind
    value
    display_name
  }
}
```

```
let query = 'query { versions { kind value display_name }}';

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-Version' : '2025-01'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     'query' : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

This query would return the following:

JSON
```
{
  "data": {
    "versions": [
      {
        "display_name": "Previous Maintenance",
        "kind": "previous_maintenance",
        "value": "2024-01"
      },
      {
        "display_name": "Maintenance",
        "kind": "maintenance",
        "value": "2024-04"
      },
      {
        "display_name": "Current",
        "kind": "current",
        "value": "2024-07"
      },
      {
        "display_name": "Release Candidate",
        "kind": "release_candidate",
        "value": "2024-10"
      }
    ]
  },
  "account_id": 1
}
```
