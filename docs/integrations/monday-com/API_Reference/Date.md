Learn how to filter, read, update, and clear the date column on monday boards using the platform API

The date column represents a specific date (and potentially time). You can filter , read , update , and clear the date column via the API.

## Filter the date column

Using the items_page object, you can easily filter a board's items by specific columns or column values.

This section explains how to use the API to filter by dates. To query items with a specific date column value, you must add an operator with one or more predefined or custom compare values. Some compare values are static (e.g., specific dates), while others are dynamic and will change according to the date and time during which you make the API call (e.g., "TOMORROW").

ðŸ’¡ The results depend on the timezone, date format, and first day of the week settings configured in the monday.com profile of the user making the API call.

The table below outlines the supported operators, compare values, and compare attributes for the date column.

### Examples

This example returns all items on board 1234567890 with a date column value of July 1st, 2023 (based on the user making the API call). To return items with a specific date, just replace the "2023-07-01" with the date you'd like to filter by!

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards(ids: [1234567890]) {
    items_page(
      query_params: {rules: [ { 
        column_id: "date", 
        compare_value: ["EXACT", "2023-07-01"], 
        operator: any_of}]}
    ) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example shows how to filter a date column with multiple compare values.

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards(ids: [1234567890]) {
    items_page(
      query_params: {rules: [ { 
        column_id: "date4", 
        compare_value: ["EXACT", "2024-09-10", "TODAY", "EXACT", "2024-09-11", "TOMORROW"], 
        operator: any_of}]}
    ) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example returns all items on board 1234567890 with a date column value that is in the current week or after (based on the user making the API call).

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards(ids: [1234567890]) {
    items_page(
      query_params: {rules: [ { 
        column_id: "date", 
        compare_value: ["THIS_WEEK"], 
        operator: greater_than_or_equals}]}
    ) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example returns all items on board 1234567890 that are not marked as "Done" in the status column and have a date column value that has not yet passed.

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards(ids: [1234567890]) {
    items_page(
      query_params: {rules: [ { 
        column_id: "date", 
        compare_value: ["UPCOMING"], 
        operator: any_of}]}
    ) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Read the date column

You can query the date column using the column_values object that object enables you to return column-specific subfields by sending a fragment in your query.  Values for the date column are of the DateValue type.

GraphQL
```
query {
  items (ids:[1234567890, 9876543210]) {
    column_values {
      ... on DateValue {
        time
        date
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fields

Field | Description
--- | ---
columnColumn! | The column the value belongs to.
dateString | The column's date value.
iconString | The selected icon as a string.
idID! | The column's unique identifier.
textString | The column's value as text. This field will return""if the column has an empty value.
timeString | The column's time value. Results are based on the timezone settings configured in the monday.com profile of theuser who made the call.
typeColumnType! | The column's type.
updated_atDate | The column's last updated date.
valueJSON | The column's JSON-formatted raw value. Results are in UTC.

## Updating the date column

You can update a date column using the change_simple_column_value mutation and sending a simple string in the value argument. You can also use the change_multiple_column_values mutation and pass a JSON string in the column_values argument.

### Simple strings

To update a date column, send the date as a string in a YYYY-MM-DD format. You can also add a time by passing it in HH:MM:SS format with a space between the date and time. (Make sure to enter the date and time in UTC, so it will be converted to the user's timezone when they look at the board!)

GraphQLJavaScript
```
mutation {
  change_simple_column_value (item_id:9876543210, board_id:1234567890, column_id:"date", value: "2019-06-03 13:25:00") {
    id
  }
}
```

```
fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query : "mutation ($myBoardId:Int!, $myItemId:Int!, $myColumnValue: String!, $columnId: String!) { change_simple_column_value (item_id:$myItemId, board_id:$myBoardId, column_id: $columnId, value: $myColumnValue) { id } }",
    variables : JSON.stringify({
      myBoardId: 1234567890,
      myItemId: 9876543210,
      columnId: "date",
      myColumnValue: "2019-06-03 13:25:00"
      })
    })
  })
```

### JSON

To update a date column with JSON, send a JSON string with a date and time key (optional). The date should also be in YYYY-MM-DD format, and the time in HH:MM:SS format. (Make sure to enter the date and time in UTC, so it will be converted to the user's timezone when they look at the board!)

GraphQLJavaScript
```
mutation {
  change_multiple_column_values(item_id:9876543210, board_id:1234567890, column_values: "{\"date\" : {\"date\" : \"1993-08-27\", \"time\" : \"18:00:00\"}}") {
    id
  }
}
```

```
fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query : "mutation ($myBoardId:Int!, $myItemId:Int!, $myColumnValues:JSON!) { change_multiple_column_values(item_id:$myItemId, board_id:$myBoardId, column_values: $myColumnValues) { id } }",
    variables : JSON.stringify({
      myBoardId: YOUR_BOARD_ID,
      myItemId: YOUR_ITEM_ID,
      myColumnValues: "{\"date\" : {\"date\" : \"1993-08-27\", \"time\": \"18:00:00\"}}"
    })
  })
})
```

## Clear the date column

You have two options to clear a date column. First, you can use the change_multiple_column_values mutation and pass null , an empty string, or an empty object in the column_values argument.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
mutation {
  change_multiple_column_values(item_id:9876543210, board_id:1234567890, column_values: "{\"date\" : null}") {
    id
  }
}
```

```
fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query : "mutation ($myBoardId:Int!, $myItemId:Int!, $myColumnValues:JSON!) { change_multiple_column_values(item_id:$myItemId, board_id:$myBoardId, column_values: $myColumnValues) { id } }",
    variables : JSON.stringify({
      myBoardId: 1234567890,
      myItemId: 9876543210,
      myColumnValues: "{\"date\" : null}"
    })
  })
})
```

You can also use the change_simple_column_value mutation and pass an empty string in the value argument.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
mutation {
  change_simple_column_value(item_id:9876543210, board_id:1234567890, column_id: "date", value: "") {
    id
  }
}
```

```
fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query : "mutation ($myBoardId:Int!, $myItemId:Int!, $myColumnValue: String!, $columnId: String!) { change_simple_column_value (item_id:$myItemId, board_id:$myBoardId, column_id: $columnId, value: $myColumnValue) { id } }",
    variables : JSON.stringify({
      myBoardId: 1234567890,
      myItemId: 9876543210,
      columnId: "date",
      myColumnValue: ""
      })
    })
  })
```
