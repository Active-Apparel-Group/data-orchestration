Learn how to query activity logs from a monday board using the platform API

Activity logs are records of all activities performed on a board. You can use them to see which actions were performed on your boards, when, and by whom.

# Queries

- Returns an array containing metadata about a collection of activity logs from a specific board
- Can only be nested within a boards query
- Limit: up to 10,000 logs total

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  boards (ids: 1234567890) {
    activity_logs (from: "2021-07-23T00:00:00Z", to: "2021-07-26T00:00:00Z") {
      id
      event
      data
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = 'query { boards (ids: 1234567890) { activity_logs (from: \"2021-07-23T00:00:00Z\", to: \"2021-07-26T00:00:00Z\") { id event data }}}';

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     'query' : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```
