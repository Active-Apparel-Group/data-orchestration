# About the API reference

A comprehensive reference of all objects, queries, and mutations supported by the platform API

The monday.com platform API reference contains documentation for our GraphQL API schema. It is divided into three reference categories:

- Marketplace API reference: Objects specifically for monday.com marketplace apps
- Emails & Activities API reference: Objects specifically for the monday.com Emails & Activities (E&A) app
- API reference: All other objects

Object types are divided into individual documents within the three categories. Each document explains the object, supported queries and mutations, and their corresponding fields and arguments.

The documents are listed alphabetically in the left-side menu. There, you will also find the API reference column types reference that walks through each supported column type and its functionality.

All other utility types and enums are listed in a separate document within their respective categories:

- Marketplace API reference other types
- Emails & Activities API reference other types
- API reference other types
