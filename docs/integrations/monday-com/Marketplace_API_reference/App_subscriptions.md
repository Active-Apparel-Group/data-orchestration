# App subscriptions

Learn how to query app subscription data using the monday.com platform API

App monetization utilizes subscriptions as a billing contract between a user and an app. Each subscription contains unique data about the user's billing frequency, plan type, and renewal period.

# Queries

- Returns an array containing data about all of your app's subscriptions
- Can only be queried directly at the root
- Only works for app collaborators
- Limit: 120 times per minute

## ðŸš§

If you only want to query a specific account's subscription from the context of your app, use the app_subscription object instead.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  app_subscriptions (app_id: 1234567890) {
    cursor
    total_count 
    subscriptions {
      account_id
      monthly_price
      currency
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { app_subscriptions (app_id: 1234567890) { cursor total_count subscriptions { account_id monthly_price currency } } }";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-Version' : '2025-01'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```
