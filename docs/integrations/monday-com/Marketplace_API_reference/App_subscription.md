# App subscription

Learn how to query app subscription data using the monday.com platform API

App monetization utilizes subscriptions as a billing contract between a user and an app. Each subscription contains unique data about the user's billing frequency, plan type, and renewal period.

# Queries

- Returns an array containing the current app and account subscription details based on the token used
- Can only be queried directly at the root
- If an account has a mock subscription and a real one, it will only return the mock subscription

## ðŸš§

This query is called on the app-level. It can only be called within the context of an app, not from the API Playground.

It only returns details based on the token used. If you want to query all of your app's subscriptions, use the app_subscriptions object instead.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  app_subscription {
    billing_period
    days_left
    is_trial
    plan_id
    renewal_date
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { app_subscription { billing_period days_left is_trial plan_id renewal_date } }";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-Version' : '2025-01'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

The example response body from the above query.

JSON
```
{ 
  "data": {
    "app_subscription":[
      {
        "billing_period": "yearly",
        "days_left": 278,
        "is_trial": true,
        "plan_id": "basic_plan_15_users",
        "renewal_date": "2023-08-27T00:00:00+00:00",
      }
    ]
  },
  "account_id": 5
}
```
