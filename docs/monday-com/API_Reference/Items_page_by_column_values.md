# Items page by column values

Learn how to read items on monday boards based on predefined column values using the platform API

Items are core objects in the monday.com platform that hold the actual data within the board. To better illustrate the platform, imagine that each board is a table and an item is a single row in that table. Now take one row, fill it with whatever information you'd like, and you now have an item!

# Queries

Required scope: boards:read

Querying items_page_by_column_values will search for items based on predefined column values and return metadata about these specific items. This method accepts various arguments and returns an array.

You can only query items_page_by_column_values directly at the root, so it can't be nested within another query. This object supports specific column types, while some only have limited support. The supported and unsupported section below outlines the support for each column and which values to send for each.

The items_page_by_column_values object allows you to combine multiple column values by sending an array. Unless specified otherwise, most column values will be used with an ANY_OF operator and only return items with all of the specified column values.

The following code sample returns 50 items from board 1234567890 that have a text column value of "This is a text column" AND a country column value of either the United States or Israel.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  items_page_by_column_values (limit: 50, board_id: 1234567890, columns: [{column_id: "text", column_values: ["This is a text column"]}, {column_id: "country", column_values: ["US", "IL"]}]) {
    cursor
    items {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { items_page_by_column_values (limit: 50, board_id: 1234567890, columns: [{column_id: \"text\", column_values: [\"This is a text column\"]}, {column_id: \"country\", column_values: [\"US\", \"IL\"]}]) { cursor items { id name }}}";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-version' : '2023-10'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

The query will also return a cursor value that represents the position in the data set after returning 50 items. You can then use that string value to return the next 50 relevant items in the data set using the next_items_page object. After returning the next cursor value, you can continue the process to paginate through the entire data set.

GraphQLJavaScript
```
query {
  next_items_page (cursor: "MSw5NzI4MDA5MDAsaV9YcmxJb0p1VEdYc1VWeGlxeF9kLDg4MiwzNXw0MTQ1NzU1MTE5", limit: 50) {
    cursor
    items {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```
let query = "query { next_items_page (cursor: \"MSw5NzI4MDA5MDAsaV9YcmxJb0p1VEdYc1VWeGlxeF9kLDg4MiwzNXw0MTQ1NzU1MTE5\", limit: 50) { cursor items { id name }}}";

fetch ("https://api.monday.com/v2", {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization' : 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'API-version' : '2023-10'
   },
   body: JSON.stringify({
     query : query
   })
  })
   .then(res => res.json())
   .then(res => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)));
```

## Arguments

You can use the following argument(s) to reduce the number of results returned in your items_page_by_column_values query. Unlike other queries, some arguments are required.

Argument | Description | Supported fields
--- | --- | ---
board_idID! | The specific board ID to return items for. | 
columns[ItemsPageByColumnValuesQuery!] | One or more columns and their values to search by.Please notethat you can't usecolumnsandcursorin the same request. We recommend usingcolumnsfor the initial request andcursorfor paginated requests. | column_idString!column_values[String]!
cursorString | An opaque token representing the position in the result set from which to resume fetching items. Use this to paginate through large result sets.Please notethat you can't usecolumnsandcursorin the same request. We recommend usingcolumnsfor the initial request andcursorfor paginated requests. | 
limitInt! | The number of items to return. The default is 25, but the maximum is 500. | 

## Fields

You can use the following field(s) to specify what information your items_page_by_column_values query will return. Please note that some fields will have their own arguments.

Field | Description
--- | ---
cursorString | An opaque cursor that represents the position in the list after the last returned item. When paginating through items, use this cursor to fetch the next set of items. There are no more items to fetch if the cursor isnull.
items[Item!]! | The items associated with the cursor.

## Supported and unsupported columns

Country | Pass the full name of the country as it appears in the UI as a string. You can also use the uppercase country code.For example:{column_id: "country", column_values: [null, "United States", "IL"]}
Date | Pass justonestring value in ISO-2 format (YYYY-MM-DD) with or without the hour, but please note that querying by the hour is not supported.For example:{column_id: "date", column_values: ["2023-08-01"]}

Please note that this column performs an exact match of theentirelabel textual value.For example:{column_id: "email", column_values: ["[emailÂ protected]", "[emailÂ protected]", null]}or{column_id: "email", column_values: ["Home email", "Work email", ""]}

Itwill notreturn just the results with that specific value.For example:{column_id: "hour", column_values: ["12:30", "EVENING", "0500", null]}(returns all items in the afternoon, evening, or morning time ranges or those with empty values)
