Learn how to read the color picker column on monday boards using the platform API

The color picker column allows you to pick specific colors on a board to help maintain a consistent board design. After selecting your color, the column will display the relevant color code in the format of your choice. You can read the color picker column via the API, but you currently cannot filter, update, or clear it.

## Read the color picker column

You can query the color picker column using the column_values object that enables you to return column-specific subfields by sending a fragment in your query.  Values for the color picker column are of the ColorPickerValue type.

GraphQL
```
query {
  items (ids:[1234567890, 9876543210]) {
    column_values {
      ... on ColorPickerValue {
        color
        updated_at
      }
    }
  }
}
```
