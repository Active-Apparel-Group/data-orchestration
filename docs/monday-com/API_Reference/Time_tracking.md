# Time tracking

Learn how to filter by and read the time tracking column on monday boards using the platform API

The time tracking column represents the total time spent on a task. You can filter by and read the time tracking column via the API, but you currently cannot update or clear it.

## Filter by the time tracking column

Using the items_page object, you can easily filter a board's items by specific columns or column values. The table below contains the time tracking column's supported operators and compare values.

Operators | Compare values
--- | ---
any_of | 1(time tracker paused or empty)2(time tracker running)
not_any_of | 1(time tracker paused or empty)2(time tracker running)

### Examples

The following example returns all items on the specified board with a running time tracker.

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards (ids: 1234567890) {
    items_page (query_params: {rules: [{column_id: "time_tracking", compare_value: [2], operator:any_of}]}) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Read the time tracking column

You can query the time tracking column using the column_values object that enables you to return column-specific subfields by sending a fragment in your query.  Values for the time tracking column are of the TimeTrackingValue type.

GraphQL
```
query {
  items (ids:[1234567890, 9876543210]) {
    column_values {
      ... on TimeTrackingValue {
        running
        started_at
      }
    }
  }
}
```
