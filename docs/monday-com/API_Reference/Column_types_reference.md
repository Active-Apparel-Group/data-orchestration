# Column types reference

The monday.com platform supports a variety of column types to store different data. Our API supports most types, allowing you to read, filter, delete, and update those columns. Most columns have some kind of support, but we also have a handful of unsupported columns.

The tables below show a list of supported and unsupported columns. You can also find a column's implementation value (see here for more info about implementations) and the column type enum value .

Each column has an individual document linked below that contains examples to read or change the values of different supported or partially supported columns. The expected formatting will vary depending on which column type's value you're attempting to change; some columns will accept only JSON values, and some will accept both Strings and JSON values.
