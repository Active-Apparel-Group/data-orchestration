Learn how to filter by and read the vote column on monday boards using the platform API

The vote column allows board subscribers and team members to vote for items. You can filter by and read the vote column via the API, but you cannot update or clear it.

## Filter by the vote column

Using the items_page object, you can easily filter a board's items by specific columns or column values. The table below contains the vote column's supported operators and compare values.

Operators | Compare values
--- | ---
any_of | The user IDs to filter by"No votes"
not_any_of | The user IDs to filter by"No votes"
is_empty | null
is_not_empty | null

### Examples

The following example returns all items on the specified board where user 123456 voted in the vote column.

GraphQL
```
query {
  boards (ids: 1234567890) {
    items_page (query_params: {rules: [{column_id: "vote", compare_value: [123456], operator:any_of}]}) {
      items {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Read the vote column

You can query the vote column using the column_values object that enables you to return column-specific subfields by sending a fragment in your query.  Values for the vote column are of the VoteValue type.

GraphQL
```
query {
  items (ids:[1234567890, 9876543210]) {
    column_values {
      ... on VoteValue {
        vote_count
        voter_ids
      }
    }
  }
}
```
