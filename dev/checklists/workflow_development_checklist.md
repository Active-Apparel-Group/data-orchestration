- [ ] Add rate limiting and retry logic
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully
- [ ] Log API interactions
- [ ] Mock API responses for testing

## Testing Phase

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test all individual functions
- [ ] Test with valid inputs
- [ ] Test with invalid inputs
- [ ] Test error conditions
- [ ] Achieve minimum 90% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with development database
- [ ] Test with API endpoints (dev/sandbox)
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Test with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Verify data quality and integrity

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Benchmark critical operations
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Measure memory usage
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Meet performance requirements

### Error Testing
- [ ] Test database connection failures
- [ ] Test API timeouts and failures
- [ ] Test invalid data scenarios
- [ ] Test system resource limitations
- [ ] Verify error logging and reporting

## Validation Phase

### Data Quality Validation
- [ ] Verify data transformation accuracy
- [ ] Check data type conversions
- [ ] Validate business rule implementation
- [ ] Test data validation functions
- [ ] Verify output data format

### Business Logic Validation
- [ ] Confirm business requirements are met
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Validate calculations and aggregations
- [ ] Test workflow decision logic
- [ ] Review with business stakeholders

### Security Validation
- [ ] Review credential management
- [ ] Check data access permissions
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Review logging for sensitive data
- [ ] Verify secure API communication

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Document complex business logic
- [ ] Add inline comments for clarity
