**Description**: Customer Master Schedule board extraction with full production features

#### Deployment Results:
- ✅ **Script Deployed**: Successfully deployed to Kestra scripts directory
- ✅ **Workflow Created**: YAML workflow validated and deployed
- ✅ **Kestra Execution**: Workflow executed successfully in production
- ✅ **Data Extraction**: Customer Master Schedule data extracted and loaded
- ✅ **Zero Downtime**: Atomic staging swap completed without interruption
- ✅ **Logging**: Clean ASCII logging confirmed in Kestra console
- ✅ **Template Validation**: Jinja2 template successfully generated production script

#### Completed Features:
- ✅ **Repository Standards Compliance**: Uses centralized db_helper, config, mapping
- ✅ **Zero-Downtime Architecture**: Atomic staging swap with <1 second downtime  
- ✅ **Dynamic Schema Handling**: Auto-adapts to Monday.com board changes
- ✅ **Production-Grade Performance**: Retry logic, bulk operations, error handling
- ✅ **Clean Monitoring**: ASCII-only logging, comprehensive progress tracking
- ✅ **API Resilience**: 60s timeout, 3-retry exponential backoff
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Robust date/number/JSON conversion with null handling
- ✅ **Test Mode Support**: Configurable TEST_MODE for development/testing
- ✅ **Full Documentation**: Complete README with usage and troubleshooting

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ **Test Mode**: Successfully processes 500-1000 record samples
- ✅ **Production Mode**: Successfully processes full dataset (3000+ records)
- ✅ **Schema Changes**: Successfully auto-adds new columns to SQL tables
- ✅ **Zero-Downtime**: Confirmed atomic swap with no data loss
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from API timeouts and DB errors

#### Performance Metrics:
- **API Fetch**: ~250 records per 15-20 seconds
- **Data Processing**: ~500 records per second  
- **Database Insert**: ~1000 records per 4-5 seconds
- **Total Time**: ~2-3 minutes per 1000 records
