# Customer Master Schedule Workflow Plan

## Overview
The Customer Master Schedule workflow manages customer delivery schedules, order tracking, and capacity planning by synchronizing data between Monday.com customer boards and the data warehouse.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-17
- **Main Script**: `scripts/customer_master_schedule/`
- **Dev Location**: `dev/customer_master_schedule/`

## Business Requirements

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Sync customer delivery schedules from Monday.com
- [ ] Track order fulfillment progress and capacity utilization
- [ ] Generate automated delivery notifications and reports
- [ ] Maintain master schedule for production planning

### Data Requirements
- **Source**: Monday.com customer boards, order management system
- **Target**: SQL Server warehouse customer and order tables
- **Frequency**: Real-time updates for orders, daily for schedules
- **Volume**: ~200 customers, ~1000 orders monthly
- **Retention**: 5 years of schedule and order history

### Business Rules
- Customer schedules override default delivery windows
- Order priority determines schedule precedence
- Capacity constraints must be respected
- Historical delivery performance tracking required

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Monday.com Customer Boards → Data Aggregation → Master Schedule

    Order Management         Capacity Planning    Warehouse Tables
```

### Key Components
1. **Customer Sync**: Monday.com customer board integration
2. **Order Aggregator**: Combine order data from multiple sources
3. **Schedule Engine**: Calculate optimal delivery schedules
4. **Capacity Manager**: Track and enforce capacity limits
5. **Notification System**: Automated alerts and reports

### Database Schema
- `customer_master` - Customer information and preferences
- `delivery_schedules` - Customer-specific delivery windows
- `order_master` - Order tracking and status
- `capacity_planning` - Resource and timeline management
- `schedule_history` - Historical schedule changes

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage on business logic
- **Integration Tests**: All external system connections
- **Performance Tests**: Handle 2x current order volume
- **Business Rule Tests**: All scheduling and capacity rules

### Test Scenarios
- **Customer Sync**: New customers, updated preferences, deactivated accounts
- **Order Processing**: Rush orders, capacity conflicts, schedule changes
- **Capacity Planning**: Peak periods, resource constraints, overtime scenarios
- **Error Handling**: API failures, data corruption, system downtime

### Test Data
- **Customer Samples**: Various customer types and delivery preferences
- **Order Scenarios**: Standard orders, rush orders, bulk orders
- **Capacity Data**: Historical utilization patterns
- **Edge Cases**: Holiday schedules, equipment maintenance

## Performance Requirements

### Processing Targets
- **Customer Sync**: Complete sync within 10 minutes
- **Order Updates**: Real-time processing (< 30 seconds)
- **Schedule Calculation**: Daily schedules generated within 5 minutes
- **Capacity Planning**: Weekly plans calculated within 15 minutes

### Scalability Requirements
- Support 500+ customers (150% growth capacity)
- Handle 2000+ orders monthly (100% growth buffer)
- Process schedule changes in real-time
- Maintain sub-second query response times

## Data Quality & Validation

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Customer data completeness validation
- [ ] Order data accuracy verification
- [ ] Schedule consistency across systems
- [ ] Capacity calculation validation

### Business Rule Validation
- [ ] Customer delivery windows respected
- [ ] Order priorities properly applied
- [ ] Capacity constraints enforced
- [ ] Historical data integrity maintained

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout
1. **Phase 1**: Deploy customer sync for 10 pilot customers
2. **Phase 2**: Add order tracking for pilot customers
3. **Phase 3**: Enable schedule calculation and capacity planning
4. **Phase 4**: Full rollout to all customers

### Rollback Plan
- Maintain parallel legacy system during transition
- Automated rollback triggers for data quality failures
- Manual rollback procedures for business rule violations
- Complete system restore within 4 hours

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Data Freshness**: Customer data < 1 hour old
- **Processing Success**: > 99% successful order updates
- **Schedule Accuracy**: < 2% variance from planned delivery
- **System Availability**: > 99.5% uptime

### Alert Thresholds
- Customer sync fails or takes > 15 minutes
- Order processing backlog > 100 items
- Schedule calculation errors > 1% of orders
- Capacity utilization > 95% for extended periods

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
- **Monday.com API Changes**: Could break customer sync
- **High Order Volume**: May overwhelm processing capacity
- **Data Quality Issues**: Could affect schedule accuracy
- **System Integration**: Complex dependencies between systems

### Mitigation Strategies
