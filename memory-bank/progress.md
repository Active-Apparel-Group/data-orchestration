# Progress

## Current Status
**Overall Project Status:** In Progress – The core system has been built and tested in a development setting, but we are in the middle of finalizing the live integration with Monday.com. Out of the 10 primary tasks planned for this project, 8 have been completed successfully. Task 9 (integration with the live API) is underway, and Task 10 (monitoring and maintenance enhancements) is not started yet.

So far, all foundational elements are in place:
- The **delta sync architecture** is operational. New orders and order lines are properly written to the delta tables (`ORDER_LIST_DELTA`, `ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA`) and flagged with initial states.
- The **Sync Engine and Monday API Client modules** have been implemented and pass all preliminary tests (with the API client still using stubs at this point).
- Comprehensive **integration tests** for the data preparation and internal logic (Tasks 1–8) have all passed. This gives confidence that the internal mechanics (SQL generation, delta handling, grouping logic) work as intended.
- The pipeline can be run in a “dry-run” mode end-to-end where it simulates API calls (without actually hitting Monday.com) and everything completes without errors, updating nothing but logs.

The key remaining work is to connect and verify the pipeline with the actual Monday.com service and then polish the solution for production use.

## What’s Working
- **Data Preparation Pipeline:** All steps leading up to the sync are working. The process of merging data into the delta tables (with dynamic columns for sizes, marking new orders, etc.) is fully functional. For example, in our test scenario, 69 new order headers and 317 line items were identified and prepared for sync (for a specific large order batch from a customer, GREYSON CLOTHIERS), and these numbers matched expectations exactly.
- **Two-Pass Sync Logic:** The orchestrated sequence (first create groups & items, then subitems, then update statuses) has been implemented and, in dry-run tests, behaves correctly. No subitem attempt is made before its parent item exists and is referenced, which means our parent-child linking strategy is solid.
- **Batching & Grouping:** The system successfully groups orders by customer and splits them into manageable batches. In tests, if we simulate 20 orders for one customer, the system will create one group and handle those orders together. If multiple customers are present, it processes each separately. This segmentation was a critical design point and is proving effective.
- **Config-Driven Flexibility:** By changing config values, we’ve tested that the pipeline can point to a different Monday.com board or different database tables without code changes. This indicates that the TOML configuration approach is working. We already have separate config sections prepared for the production environment.
- **Logging & Visibility:** The pipeline logs detailed information about each step (e.g., how many items are about to be sent to Monday, any errors encountered). We have not yet integrated a monitoring dashboard, but the groundwork with logging is there to build on.
- **Testing & QA:** We have a strong test suite for the core logic. For instance, tests confirm that:
  - All required database columns (including `record_uuid`) are being read.
  - The Jinja2 templates produce correct SQL for the current schema.
  - The sync engine’s internal methods (like grouping and linking item IDs) produce expected results.

## What’s Left to Build
- **Monday.com API Live Integration:** The immediate next step is to finish and test the actual API calls (Task 9.0). We need to ensure that when we run the pipeline with `dry_run=False`, it will:
  - Create the groups on Monday.com for new customers (if not already there).
  - Create items and subitems on the Monday.com board with correct column values.
  - Receive the new item IDs and map them back to our records.
  - Do all the above while respecting rate limits and not timing out.
- **Field Mapping Expansion:** Currently, the pipeline only maps a handful of fields to Monday.com (Order Number, Customer Name, PO Number, Style, Total Qty for headers; size and qty for lines). However, our actual Monday board has many more columns (estimated 15-20 columns, including dates, statuses, notes, etc.). We need to gather all those column IDs and update `sync_order_list.toml` accordingly (Task 13.0, which is upcoming). Without this, some important data won’t be synced, so this is high priority after basic integration works.
- **Production Board Setup:** We must verify that the production Monday.com board (ID `8709134353`) has all the necessary structure and columns to receive the data. This might involve coordination with the team that manages Monday.com. We’ll use our dev board tests as a guide to ensure the production board is configured similarly.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** For production use, we plan to implement monitoring (Task 10.1: Sync Monitoring). This could be as simple as a script that checks for any orders stuck in `PENDING` state for too long and sends an alert, or integrating with our logging/monitoring infrastructure to catch errors. We also want to periodically clean up old records from the delta tables (Task 10.2) so they don’t grow unbounded, archiving or deleting records that have been synced and are older than a threshold.
- **Performance Tuning:** Once the live calls are in place, we’ll evaluate performance. If the current conservative approach is significantly under-utilizing the allowed rate (for example, if we find we’re only doing 2 requests/sec but could do 10 safely), we may tune the concurrency or batch sizes to speed up the sync. Conversely, if any instability is observed, we might introduce more throttling. There’s also a task (10.3) to look at batch size tuning and concurrency optimization.
- **Edge Case Handling:** We need to test and handle certain edge cases, such as:
  - Very large orders (orders with an unusually high number of line items) – does our subitem creation handle large subitem batches properly?
  - Simultaneous new orders for a new customer and an existing customer – ensure group creation logic doesn’t conflict.
  - API failures – for example, what if Monday.com returns a transient error? We plan to implement retries for failures and ensure that the pipeline can resume gracefully.
  - Data mismatches – e.g., if a required column is missing in the config or a data field is too long for a Monday column, how do we handle it? These cases might need either data cleaning or adjustments in config.
- **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:** As part of project completion, all these memory bank documents need to be kept up-to-date. So far, we’ve updated them to reflect the current state. We will continue to update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` as tasks 9 and 10 proceed, so that any team member or the AI assistant can quickly get context after a break (or “memory reset”).

## Known Issues and Risks
- **Incomplete Column Mapping:** (High Priority to fix) As mentioned, not all necessary fields are currently syncing. This isn’t a bug in the code per se, but a gap in configuration that will result in missing data on the Monday board until addressed.
- **Rate Limit Uncertainty:** While we’ve been conservative, the true behavior of the Monday API under our usage patterns will only be known once we test. There’s a risk we may still hit limits or find that certain GraphQL mutations are too “complex” (Monday has a concept of query complexity) especially when batch creating many subitems. We’ll mitigate this by careful testing and have a plan to break payloads into smaller pieces if needed.
- **Dependency on Upstream Data Quality:** The sync assumes that the upstream pipeline provides clean and correct data (e.g., every `record_uuid` in the lines table has a matching header in the headers table, no required fields are null). If there are data issues upstream, those could cause sync failures. We may need to add validation or at least robust error logging for such cases.
- **Operational Handoff:** As we near production, we’ll have to ensure the operations team is ready to monitor this. A risk is if they are not aware of how to interpret the sync states or logs, an issue could go unnoticed. We aim to mitigate this by possibly adding a summary report of each run (like how many orders synced, how many failed) that could be emailed or posted somewhere.
- **Timeline:** We have to be mindful of the project timeline. The integration with Monday is a dependency for some business initiatives (perhaps they want this live by a certain date to improve their processes). Any unforeseen obstacle (like extended debugging of API calls) could crunch the timeline. Having a working dev version soon will give confidence and allow us to buffer any adjustments.

## Timeline of Progress
- *2025-01-22:* Core architecture refactor completed. Tasks 1–8 finished, which was a major milestone (“Architecture Revolution Completed”). System was able to run end-to-end in dry-run mode with all tests passing.
- *2025-07-22:* Began active development on live API integration (after a pause or other projects in between). Updated documentation and restarted work on Task 9. In the interim between Jan and July, the system was stable in dev (with dry-run) but not yet deployed. Now we are accelerating towards deployment.
- *[Upcoming]* *2025-08 (Planned):* Complete end-to-end testing in development including live API calls (Task 12.0), then proceed to production configuration and testing. Aim to have the system in a production trial by end of August, with monitoring in place.

The project is moving forward steadily. Each completed task has reinforced that our design is sound, and the remaining work primarily involves integration and hardening. We are confident that with the foundation laid down, the final pieces will fall into place to achieve a successful deployment.
