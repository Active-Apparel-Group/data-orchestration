# Progress

## Current Status
**Overall Project Status:** 90% Complete - DELTA-free architecture core operational, critical dropdown and group functionality in progress.

**Major Milestone In Progress**: Task 19.15 E2E Monday.com Sync Integration 75% complete. Core sync working (10/10 batches, 59 records), SQL nesting error resolved. Critical work remaining: dropdown column population and group creation workflow.

## What's Working
- **DELTA-Free Main Table Architecture**: Direct merge operations on ORDER_LIST_V2 and ORDER_LIST_LINES work flawlessly. System successfully merges data using business key logic without complex DELTA propagation.
- **Monday.com Integration**: Real API integration operational with 100% success rate. Two-pass sync logic (headers→items, lines→subitems) with proper parent-child linking.
- **Configuration-Driven System**: TOML configuration drives all operations without code changes. Separate dev/prod configurations validated.
- **Template-Driven SQL Generation**: Jinja2 templates handle dynamic schema changes (245 size columns) with business key logic.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Strong integration test suite validates core logic, templates, and end-to-end workflows.

## Timeline of Progress
- **2025-01-24**: Task 19.15 75% COMPLETE - Core sync working, SQL nesting error resolved, dropdown/group issues identified
- **2025-01-24**: Task 19.14.4 COMPLETED - Production cancelled order validation integrated
- **2025-01-23**: Task 19.14.3 COMPLETED - Data merge integration validation (100% success rate)
- **2025-01-23**: Task 19.0 DELTA Architecture Elimination COMPLETED - Revolutionary simplification achieved
- **2025-01-22**: Core architecture refactor completed (Tasks 1-8) - System operational in dry-run mode
- **2025-01-18**: DELTA Tables Architecture completed

## What's Left to Build
**Remaining Tasks (10% of project)**:
- **Task 19.15 Completion**: 
  - Dropdown column population (AAG SEASON, CUSTOMER SEASON fields)
  - Group creation workflow implementation (create groups BEFORE items)
  - TOML configuration enhancement for dropdown handling and group management
- **Task 19.16**: Performance validation and benchmarking (≥200 records/sec)
- **Task 19.17-19.18**: Final DELTA table cleanup and removal
- **Task 19.19-19.23**: Documentation updates and production deployment preparation
- **Task 20**: Change detection logic for UPDATE scenarios

**Production Readiness Requirements**:
- Performance benchmarking completion
- Final DELTA table removal
- Production configuration validation
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Known Issues and Risks
- **Performance Validation Pending**: Need to confirm DELTA-free architecture meets performance targets
- **Legacy Cleanup**: ORDER_LIST_DELTA and ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA tables ready for safe removal
- **Monitoring Integration**: Production monitoring and alerting requires implementation
- **Documentation Updates**: System documentation needs updates to reflect DELTA-free architecture

**Project on track for successful completion with remaining work focused on optimization and production preparation.**
