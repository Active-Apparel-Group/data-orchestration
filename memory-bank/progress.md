## Historical Context
**Foundation Achievements**: The project successfully evolved from a monolithic approach to a phase-based architecture with DELTA table elimination. Key technical breakthroughs include:
- Complete elimination of complex DELTA propagation logic
- Direct main table operations with sync column tracking
- Real Monday.com API integration with dynamic dropdown creation
- SQL nesting error resolution enabling flawless API integration
- 100% E2E test validation with production-like data

**Delta Sync Architecture Legacy**: Original system included operational delta tables (`ORDER_LIST_DELTA`, `ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA`) with state management, but this was successfully replaced with direct main table operations for improved performance and reliability.

**Testing Evolution**: Comprehensive integration test suite developed for core logic validation including database operations, SQL template generation, and sync engine functionality. Dry-run mode capability allows end-to-end testing without API calls.

## Summary

The project has reached a critical planning phase with comprehensive technical documentation created for both change detection implementation and production deployment. The DELTA-free architecture foundation is proven operational, but critical validation gaps in Task 19.15 must be resolved before proceeding to production. Planning documentation now provides clear roadmap for implementation and deployment readiness, with both TASK020 and TASK021 properly formatted according to project standards.
