# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Task 19.16 - Performance Testing & Benchmarking**: Validate DELTA-free architecture performance metrics ≥200+ records/sec and ensure no performance regression compared to legacy DELTA approach. Following successful completion of Task 19.15 with 100% Monday.com sync integration success.

## Recent Changes

**2025-01-24**: **Task 19.15 COMPLETED** - Revolutionary breakthrough achieved with 100% success rate (10/10 batches, 59 records synced). Real Monday.com API integration working flawlessly. SQL nesting error completely resolved through database trigger optimization (disabled duplicate trigger `tr_ORDER_LIST_LINES_updated_at`).

**2025-01-24**: **Task 19.14.4 COMPLETED** - Production cancelled order validation successfully integrated into merge_orchestrator.py with proper architectural patterns. All tests passing.

**2025-01-23**: **Task 19.14.3 COMPLETED** - Data Merge Integration Test achieved 100% success rate with complete merge workflow validation (69 headers merged, 264 lines created, 53/53 sync consistency).

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus**: Task 19.16 - Performance Testing & Benchmarking
- Goal: Validate DELTA-free architecture performance ≥200+ records/sec  
- Approach: Baseline measurement, comparative analysis vs legacy DELTA approach
- Success Criteria: No performance regression, demonstrate architectural benefits

**Upcoming Task Sequence**:
- Task 19.17-19.18: Safe removal of ORDER_LIST_DELTA and ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA tables
- Task 19.19-19.23: Documentation updates and production deployment preparation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

**DELTA-Free Architecture Validated**: Complete DELTA-free pipeline is fully operational with perfect Monday.com integration. Root cause of SQL nesting error identified and resolved - duplicate database triggers were causing recursive execution exceeding SQL Server's 32-level limit.

**Performance Focus**: Current focus is on validating performance metrics and finalizing cleanup of legacy DELTA architecture components.
