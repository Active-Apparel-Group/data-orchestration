# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Task 19.15 - Monday.com E2E Sync Integration (75% Complete - IN PROGRESS)**: 
Core sync working but critical dropdown columns unpopulated. Need group creation before items and TOML dropdown configuration.

## Recent Changes

**2025-01-24**: **Task 19.15 MAJOR PROGRESS** - Core sync working (10/10 batches, 59 records synced). SQL nesting error resolved. **CRITICAL REMAINING**: Dropdown columns unpopulated (AAG SEASON, CUSTOMER SEASON), group creation workflow incomplete.

**2025-01-24**: **Task 19.14.4 COMPLETED** - Production cancelled order validation successfully integrated into merge_orchestrator.py with proper architectural patterns. All tests passing.

**2025-01-23**: **Task 19.14.3 COMPLETED** - Data Merge Integration Test achieved 100% success rate with complete merge workflow validation (69 headers merged, 264 lines created, 53/53 sync consistency).

## Next Steps

**Immediate Focus**: Complete Task 19.15 - Monday.com E2E Sync Integration
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix dropdown column population (AAG SEASON, CUSTOMER SEASON)
2. **CRITICAL**: Implement group creation workflow before item creation
3. **REQUIRED**: Add TOML configuration for dropdown handling and group management

**Upcoming**: Task 19.16 - Performance Testing & Benchmarking (after 19.15 completion)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

**DELTA-Free Architecture Core Working**: Basic sync pipeline operational with SQL nesting error resolved. **CRITICAL GAPS**: Dropdown column population failing, group creation logic incomplete, TOML configuration missing dropdown handling features.

**Current Focus**: Completing dropdown functionality and group management before performance validation.
