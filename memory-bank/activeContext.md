**Upcoming**: TASK027 Phase 3 - Structured Logging System implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**COMPREHENSIVE SYNC ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE ‚úÖ - ALL FUNCTIONALITY VALIDATED:**

**Recent Session Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ **Database Payload Logging**: Confirmed active with request/response payloads stored in api_request_payload/api_response_payload columns
- ‚úÖ **JSONB Redundancy Elimination**: Removed 261-line error_payload_logger.py file and 160+ lines from api_logging_archiver.py
- ‚úÖ **Sync Status Reporting Fix**: Fixed bug where successful customer syncs were showing "Failed" status in reports
- ‚úÖ **Group Creation Architecture Fix**: Implemented comprehensive group_id updates affecting ALL pending records, not just current batch
- ‚úÖ **Executive Summary Enhancement**: Added customer results table showing Customer, Status (‚úÖ/‚ùå), Records Processed, Errors, Execution Time

**Production Validation Results:**
- ‚úÖ **GREYSON Test**: 1 record processed successfully with proper group creation (group_mkte36vn)
- ‚úÖ **Customer Results Table**: Working perfectly showing GREYSON | ‚úÖ SUCCESS | 1 | 0 | 6.72s
- ‚úÖ **Database Updates**: 392 total records updated with correct group_id across customer
- ‚úÖ **Executive Summary**: Enhanced format with customer breakdown immediately after status header

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- **api_logging_archiver.py**: Removed log_error_payloads_to_jsonb() and _analyze_monday_error() methods (160+ lines cleaned)

**Upcoming**: TASK027 Phase 3 - Structured Logging System implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**TASK027 PHASE 3 READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - STRUCTURED LOGGING SYSTEM:**

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
- ÔøΩ **Unique Log Identifiers**: Implement format `{2-char-prefix}-{3-digit-number}` for precise issue tracking
- ÔøΩ **Logging ID Registry**: Create sequence tracking system for each source file
- üéØ **Retrofit Existing Logging**: Add unique identifiers to all logging statements across sync system
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Verbosity Configuration**: Control debug output levels by component and severity

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **File Prefix Assignment**: Define 2-character codes for each source file (e.g., `se` = sync_engine, `ac` = api_client, `cl` = cli)
2. **Sequence Registry System**: Create centralized tracking of log sequence numbers per file
3. **Logging Enhancement**: Retrofit all existing log statements with unique identifiers
4. **Configuration System**: Implement verbosity controls for different logging levels

**Ready for Phase 3 Implementation**: All prerequisites complete, sync system stable and validated
