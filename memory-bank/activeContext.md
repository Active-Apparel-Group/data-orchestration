## Next Steps
**Immediate Focus**: TASK027 Phase 2 - Enhanced Customer Reporting

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 - SYNC-BASED OUTPUT ORGANIZATION (COMPLETED)**:
‚úÖ **Sync Folder Structure**: Created `reports/sync/{SYNC-ID-YYYYMMDD}/` organization  
‚úÖ **Customer Report Relocation**: Customer reports redirected to sync-specific folders
‚úÖ **Executive Summary Persistence**: `_SYNC_SUMMARY.md` automatically generated per sync session
‚úÖ **Sync ID Integration**: Consistent Sync ID usage across all output components and CLI display

**üéØ PHASE 2 - ENHANCED CUSTOMER REPORTING (IN PROGRESS)**:
1. **Sync-Centric Reports**: Restructure customer reports to focus on current sync session data
2. **FACT_ORDER_LIST Optimization**: Query only for errors and pending records, not primary sync data
3. **Session Context**: Add sync session statistics and timing metrics to customer reports
4. **API/Database Error Integration**: Include sync-specific error analysis in customer reports

**PRODUCTION VALIDATED CAPABILITIES**:
- **Organized Traceability**: Complete sync session organization with historical reference ‚úÖ
- **Executive Documentation**: Persistent sync summaries for stakeholder reporting ‚úÖ
- **Sync ID Generation**: Unique session identifiers with timestamp format ‚úÖ
- **Folder Organization**: Structured output with customer_reports/, logs/, summaries/ subdirectories ‚úÖ

**Upcoming**: TASK027 Phase 3 (Structured Logging) and Phase 4 (Testing & Validation)

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**TASK027 IMPLEMENTATION READY - COMPREHENSIVE ENHANCEMENT PLAN:**

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
- üìÅ **Sync-Based Organization**: Create `reports/sync/{SYNC-ID-YYYYMMDD}/` folder structure per sync session
- üìä **Enhanced Customer Reports**: Include sync session data, minimize FACT_ORDER_LIST queries to errors/pending only
- üîç **Structured Logging**: Implement unique identifiers (format: `{2-char-prefix}-{3-digit-number}`) for precise issue tracking
- üìã **Executive Summary Persistence**: Save comprehensive terminal output summaries as markdown files

**Technical Architecture Decisions:**
- ‚úÖ **Sync ID Integration**: Leverage existing Sync ID generation for consistent output organization
- ‚úÖ **Report Enhancement Strategy**: Modify api_logging_archiver.py to include sync session context
- ‚úÖ **Logging ID Registry**: Create file-based sequence tracking for unique log identifiers
- ‚úÖ **Output Management**: Centralize sync-based folder creation in sync_engine.py

**Priority Implementation Sequence:**
1. **High Priority**: Sync-based output organization (immediately needed for production runs)
2. **High Priority**: Enhanced customer reporting (critical for operational visibility)
3. **Medium Priority**: Structured logging system (important for debugging and issue tracking)
4. **Critical**: Comprehensive testing and validation (required before production deployment)

**Success Validation Criteria:**
- **Output Organization**: All sync outputs properly organized in sync-specific folders
- **Report Enhancement**: Customer reports include sync session context with minimal FACT_ORDER_LIST usage
- **Logging Precision**: All log entries have unique identifiers enabling exact issue location
- **Historical Traceability**: Executive summaries provide complete sync session documentation
