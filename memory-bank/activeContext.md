**2025-08-08**: **TASK036 BUILD SUCCESS** - TypeScript compilation issues resolved, React development environment operational
**2025-08-07**: **TASK033 COMPLETED** - Centralized Monday.com rate limiting system complete across ALL scripts
**2025-08-07**: **TASK034 COMPLETED** - All optimization requirements implemented and production-validated
**2025-08-07**: **TASK034 MIGRATION** - Database table creation moved to proper migration (025_create_dropdown_values_table.sql)
**2025-08-07**: **TASK034 PERFORMANCE** - MERGE/UPSERT operations achieving 10-100x performance improvement over row-by-row
**2025-08-07**: **TASK034 NAMING** - Table renamed to MON_Dropdown_Values per project standards
**2025-08-07**: **TASK034 DOCUMENTATION** - Comprehensive runbook created for production operations

## Next Steps
**Immediate Focus**: TASK036 Phase 2 - Complete React frontend API integration
- Frontend-backend connection and real-time progress tracking
- End-to-end upload workflow validation
- Production deployment preparation

**Upcoming**: Strategic selection of next high-impact development priority after TASK036 completion
- **Option 1**: TASK030 completion - Fix remaining sync reporting calculation issues for production accuracy
- **Option 2**: TASK025 advancement - Continue async batch item creation for 5-10x sync performance improvement  
- **Option 3**: TASK026 finalization - Complete performance optimization with default batch mode

**Strategic Context**: With foundational systems complete (extraction, configuration, rate limiting), focus shifts to:
- Production sync engine optimization and reliability
- Advanced monitoring and reporting capabilities  
- Large-scale performance enhancements
- System integration and workflow automation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
**TASK036 Breakthrough Achieved**:
- **âœ… Phase 1 Complete**: React frontend + FastAPI backend infrastructure operational (65%+ complete)
- **âœ… Technical Foundation**: TypeScript + Material-UI frontend, 8 REST API endpoints, drag-and-drop file upload working
- **âœ… Build System**: All dependencies installed, compilation successful, development server running
- **ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority**: Phase 2 frontend-backend integration for complete upload workflow

Foundation Systems Complete:
- **âœ… TASK033**: Centralized Monday.com configuration system complete across ALL scripts (ingestion + updates)
- **âœ… TASK034**: Enterprise dropdown extraction with MERGE/UPSERT 10-100x performance and migration-based schema
- **âœ… TASK036 Phase 1**: React Web Interface backend infrastructure + frontend structure complete
- **âœ… Infrastructure**: Production-validated rate limiting, optimal batch sizing, comprehensive documentation
