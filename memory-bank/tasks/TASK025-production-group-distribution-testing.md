# TASK025 - Production Group Distribution Testing

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-07-31  
**Updated:** 2025-07-31

## Original Request
After implementing sync engine group ID fix (TASK023), execute production testing to validate that group distribution is working correctly - records should distribute across different customer-based Monday.com groups instead of all landing in the same group.

## Thought Process
**Testing Strategy:**
The sync engine group ID fix is implemented and validated with test data showing proper group_id retrieval. Now need to validate this works in production with actual Monday.com API calls to ensure records distribute correctly across customer groups.

**Production Testing Flow:**
```
Limited Test (--limit 10) â†’ Group Distribution Validation â†’ Full Scale Test â†’ Monitoring Implementation
```

**Critical Success Criteria:**
- Records distribute across multiple customer-based groups (not all in same group)
- Each customer's records go to appropriate group (WHITE FOX â†’ group_mktbe8rd, PELOTON â†’ group_mktbv53t, etc.)
- Group assignment uses existing database group_id values (not fallback logic)
- Monday.com API receives correct group_id for each record

## Definition of Done

- All production tests validate group distribution working correctly
- No implementation task is marked complete until test results confirm proper group assignment
- Production monitoring confirms ongoing group distribution health
- All tests use production environment and actual Monday.com boards

## Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Limited production test with 10 records to validate group distribution
- **Phase 2**: Analyze results to confirm records distribute across different groups
- **Phase 3**: Full-scale production test if limited test successful
- **Phase 4**: Implement ongoing monitoring for group distribution issues

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Pending - 0% - Ready to begin production testing

| Group distribution validation      | Monday.com board inspection                           | Each customer group receives appropriate records |
| Full production test               | CLI --environment production (complete sync)         | All 1000+ records distribute properly          |
| Monitoring implementation          | Database queries + Monday.com group analysis         | Ongoing group distribution health               |
