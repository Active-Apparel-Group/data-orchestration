# TASK025 - Async Batch Item Creation

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-07-31  
**Updated:** 2025-07-31

## Original Request
Implement async batch item creation for Monday.com sync engine to achieve 5-10x performance improvement on large datasets, with proper Enterprise rate limiting (1M complexity points/minute, 100K points/request).

## Thought Process
Building on TASK024's success with subitem skipping, we can achieve even greater performance gains by batching item creation. Monday.com Enterprise allows high-volume operations with proper rate limiting:

- **Current**: Single item creation (10-50 complexity points per API call)
- **Target**: Async batch creation (process 50-100 items per batch with intelligent rate limiting)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect 1M complexity/minute limit with adaptive batching
- **Performance Goal**: 5-10x improvement for large datasets (100+ records)

## Definition of Done

- CLI flag `--item-mode` added with options: `single`, `batch`, `asyncBatch`
- Async batch item creation implemented with Enterprise rate limiting
- Adaptive batch sizing based on complexity calculations
- Rate limit monitoring and backoff logic
- Integration test validates performance improvement
- Production test shows 5-10x speed improvement on 50+ record dataset
- All business-critical paths covered by integration tests

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] 1.1 Add CLI argument `--item-mode` with validation
- [ ] 1.2 Implement rate limiting calculator for Monday.com Enterprise
- [ ] 1.3 Create adaptive batch sizing logic
- [ ] 1.4 Implement async batch item creation with backoff
- [ ] 1.5 Update sync engine to use new item creation modes
- [ ] 1.6 Create integration test for performance validation
- [ ] 1.7 Production test with 50+ records for performance measurement

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 70%

## Relevant Files

- `src/pipelines/sync_order_list/cli.py` - Add --item-mode CLI argument
- `src/pipelines/sync_order_list/sync_engine.py` - Already has async batch support, needs rate limiting
- `src/pipelines/sync_order_list/monday_api_client.py` - Rate limiting implementation
- `tests/sync_order_list_monday/integration/test_async_batch_items.py` - Performance test
