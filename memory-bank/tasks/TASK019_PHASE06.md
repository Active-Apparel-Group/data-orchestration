# TASK019_PHASE06 - DELTA Cleanup & Production Readiness

**Status:** ðŸ”„ NOT STARTED  
**Added:** 2025-07-25  
**Updated:** 2025-07-25

## Original Request
Complete the DELTA table elimination project with safe DELTA table cleanup and comprehensive production readiness preparation. Ensure the revolutionary DELTA-free architecture is fully documented and ready for production deployment.

## Thought Process
With the core technical work complete (Tasks 19.15-19.16), we can safely remove the DELTA tables that are no longer needed and prepare for production deployment. This cleanup must be gradual, reversible, and thoroughly documented to ensure operational success.

## Definition of Done
- ORDER_LIST_DELTA and ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA tables safely dropped
- All DELTA infrastructure completely removed
- Production configuration validated and tested  
- Complete documentation updated for DELTA-free architecture
- Operations team trained and procedures updated
- Production deployment procedures ready and tested

## Implementation Plan
- 19.17 Safe removal of ORDER_LIST_DELTA table (gradual disable â†’ drop)
- 19.18 Safe removal of ORDER_LIST_LINES_DELTA table (gradual disable â†’ drop)
- 19.19 Update architecture documentation to reflect DELTA-free design
- 19.20 Production configuration validation and environment testing
- 19.21 Dynamic environment switching validation (dev â†” prod)
- 19.22 Production cutover preparation and rollback procedures
- 19.23 Cancelled orders production validation (ORDER_TYPE='CANCELLED')
