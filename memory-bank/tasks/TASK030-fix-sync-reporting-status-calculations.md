# TASK030 - Fix Sync Reporting Status Calculations

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** 2025-08-03  
**Updated:** 2025-08-03

## Original Request
**EXPANDED AFTER PRODUCTION RUN** - Fix critical sync reporting issues where status calculations are incorrect across customer reports and executive summaries. Additional issues discovered during production testing:

### Original Issues (Phases 1-2 ✅ COMPLETED):
1. **INCORRECT SYNC STATUS LOGIC**: `customer_success = customer_successful_batches > 0` allows 50% batch failure to show as "Success" ✅
2. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CALCULATION ERRORS**: SQL queries count wrong records as "successful" and show 0 pending when 15+ exist ✅
3. **SYNC SESSION DATA INCONSISTENCY**: Reports show "✅ Success" while batch success rate shows 50% failure ✅
4. **MISSING BATCH SUCCESS THRESHOLDS**: No proper success rate thresholds (should be ≥95% success, 80-94% partial, <80% failed) ✅

### NEW CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED (Production Run Analysis):
5. **RECORDS PROCESSED MISMATCH**: Executive summary shows 0 records processed, customer report shows 2 - incorrect data flow
6. **BATCH vs RECORD COUNT CONFUSION**: Summary appears to show batch count (0/1) instead of actual records processed (2)
7. **SYNC STATE NOT UPDATED FOR FAILURES**: Records remain 'PENDING' after failed API calls instead of 'FAILED'
8. **MISSING ERROR MESSAGE EXTRACTION**: API errors logged but not extracted to readable error messages
9. **NO API_ERROR_MESSAGE COLUMN**: Need dedicated column for extracted error messages ('Group not found')
10. **BATCH SUCCESS RATE DISPLAY**: Need separate column showing batch count (0/1) vs percentage (0.0%)

## Thought Process
**Root Cause Analysis Complete**: After examining sync_engine.py and api_logging_archiver.py, identified 6 critical issues affecting production reporting accuracy:

**Current Broken Logic**:
- SUMMERSALT: 4/8 batches successful = 50% = shows "✅ SUCCESS" ❌
- TITLE NINE: Partial success = shows "✅ SUCCESS" ❌  
- Executive Summary: 36 total, 20 loaded, shows 36 "successful" ❌

**Should Show**:
- SUMMERSALT: 50% batch success = "❌ FAILED" or "⚠️ PARTIAL"
- TITLE NINE: 82% success = "⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION" 
- Executive Summary: Accurate success/pending/failed counts

**Implementation Strategy**: Fix in 4 phases prioritized by production impact.

## Definition of Done

- All code implementation tasks have a corresponding test/validation sub-task (integration testing is the default, unit tests by exception - but acceptable, the agent or developer should make this call and flag for review, e2e for end-to-end flows).
- No implementation task is marked complete until the relevant test(s) pass and explicit success criteria (acceptance criteria) are met.
- Business or user outcomes are validated with production-like data whenever feasible.
- Every task and sub-task is cross-linked to the corresponding file and test for traceability.
- All tests must pass in CI/CD prior to merging to main.
- **All business-critical paths must be covered by integration tests.**

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Success Logic & Thresholds (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **1.1**: Update customer success calculation in sync_engine.py (line 807) ✅
- **1.2**: Add configurable success thresholds (95%, 80%) to TOML config ✅
- **1.3**: Implement status categories: ✅ Success (≥95%), ⚠️ Partial (80-94%), ❌ Failed (<80%) ✅

### Phase 2: Fix Executive Summary SQL & Status Consistency (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **2.1**: Fix "successful" count SQL in api_logging_archiver.py (line 579) ✅
- **2.2**: Fix "pending" count SQL to include all sync_state='PENDING' records ✅
- **2.3**: Align sync session status with batch success rate calculations ✅
- **2.4**: Update overall result thresholds in executive summary ✅

### Phase 3: Database State Management & Error Handling (HIGH PRIORITY) 🚨 **NEW CRITICAL**
- **3.1**: Add api_error_message NVARCHAR(MAX) column to FACT_ORDER_LIST table
- **3.2**: Update batch processing to set sync_state='FAILED' for failed API calls
- **3.3**: Extract error messages from API responses ('Group not found' from error array)
- **3.4**: Ensure failed batch records update to 'FAILED' state with error message
- **3.5**: Fix records processed count mismatch between executive summary and customer reports

### Phase 4: Enhanced Summary & Batch Reporting (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **4.1**: Fix executive summary records processed count (showing 0 instead of 2) ✅
- **4.2**: Add separate batch success columns: "Batches" (0/1) and "Rate" (0.0%) ✅
- **4.3**: Update _SYNC_SUMMARY.md filename to include sync ID and status ✅ **OUTPUT HARMONIZATION**
- **4.4**: Add comprehensive batch statistics table to executive summary ✅
- **4.5**: Fix group processing summary data flow (missing group data issue) ✅

### Phase 5: OUTPUT HARMONIZATION - Retry vs Sync Consistency ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **5.1**: Sync folder integration for retry command - modified `retry_failed_records()` ✅
- **5.2**: Enhanced CLI retry command with --generate-report flag and sync folder support ✅
- **5.3**: Executive summary generation for retry operations with operation-specific content ✅
- **5.4**: Comprehensive validation testing framework for output consistency ✅
- **5.5**: TASK030 Phase 4.3 filename format implementation ({SYNC_ID}_SUMMARY.md) ✅

### Phase 6: Production Validation & Error Recovery (PENDING)
- **6.1**: Create script to fix existing PENDING records that should be FAILED
- **6.2**: Validate all error scenarios show proper status and error messages
- **6.3**: Test SUMMERSALT scenario: 2 records, 1 failed batch = "❌ FAILED" status
- **6.4**: Implement error message parsing for all Monday.com API error types

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 75% (Phases 1-2, 4-5 Complete, Phase 3 & 6 Pending)
