# TASK032 - Async Batch Monday.com Board Loader

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** 2025-08-06  
**Updated:** 2025-08-06

## Original Request
Create a batch/async version of `load_boards.py` that efficiently extracts large Monday.com boards using a two-phase approach:
1. Sequential cursor-based ID harvest (items_page/next_items_page)
2. Fully async batch detail fetch (items(ids: [...]))

Follow project import standards (#file:imports.guidance.instructions.md) and use best practices from the reference implementation.

## Thought Process
- Monday.com cursor pagination is inherently sequential; you must walk the cursor chain to harvest all item IDs.
- Once IDs are collected, detail fetches can be parallelized in batches (100–200 IDs per request) using asyncio/aiohttp.
- This approach maximizes throughput while respecting Monday.com complexity limits and API rate limits.
- The new loader should be robust, production-ready, and integrate with existing config/registry patterns.

## Definition of Done
- Async batch loader script created in the correct folder (not repo root)
- Follows import and coding standards from #file:imports.guidance.instructions.md
- Implements two-phase extraction: sequential ID harvest, async detail fetch
- Configurable batch size and concurrency
- Integration with config/registry and logging
- Validated with a large board (1000+ items)
- Documented in memory bank and tasks index

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create new script: `pipelines/scripts/ingestion/load_boards_async.py`
- [ ] Implement sequential cursor-based ID harvest
- [ ] Implement async batch detail fetch using aiohttp/asyncio
- [ ] Integrate config loading, registry update, and logging
- [ ] Add CLI interface for board ID, batch size, concurrency
- [ ] Validate with large board and document results
- [ ] Update memory bank and tasks index
