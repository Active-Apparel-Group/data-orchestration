# Development Task Execution Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Execution Methodology

For EVERY action you are about to take, follow this structured approach:

### 1. **Pre-Action Planning**
- **Summarize task goals** (high-level dot points)
- **Reference current task file** and template
- **Check instructions, docs, and reference files**
- **Ask yourself**: Am I approaching this correctly? Have I read my task, docs, reference files, instructions?

### 2. **Execute Actions**
- Perform the planned action
- Document what was done

### 3. **Post-Action Review**
- **Show original goals**
- **Mark completed items with** âœ…
- **If any failures**:
  - Update goals with error notes
  - Document corrective action taken
  - Document preventative action for future
- **Stop and self-assess**: Is this the right approach?

### 4. **Iterate Until Complete**
- If not finished, execute revised action
- Continue until all goals achieved

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Standards

- **Always reference project files** before making changes
- **Use existing working implementations** as foundation
- **Don't break 75% completed working code**
- **Focus on documentation consolidation**, not schema changes
- **Follow senior dev guidance** on mapping file creation
- **Create validation-first workflow**: SQL â†’ Mapping â†’ GraphQL â†’ Validation â†’ Test

## ðŸš¨ Critical Rules

- **NO CODE CHANGES** without explicit approval
- **Investigate existing implementations** before suggesting fixes
- **Document mapping relationships** from working code
- **Consolidate fragmented documentation** into single source of truth
- **Validate against actual working schema**, not assumptions

Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.
