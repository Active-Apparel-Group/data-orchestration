# Customer Master Schedule Subitems Workflow Plan

## Overview
The Customer Master Schedule Subitems workflow manages detailed sub-tasks and deliverables within customer delivery schedules, providing granular tracking and management of complex order fulfillment processes.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development Planning
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-17
- **Main Script**: `scripts/customer_master_schedule_subitems/`
- **Dev Location**: `dev/customer_master_schedule_subitems/`

## Business Requirements

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Track detailed sub-tasks within customer delivery schedules
- [ ] Manage dependencies between schedule items and subitems
- [ ] Provide granular progress tracking for complex deliveries
- [ ] Enable detailed resource allocation and capacity planning

### Data Requirements
- **Sources**: Monday.com subitem boards, task management systems
- **Target**: SQL Server warehouse subitem and dependency tables
- **Frequency**: Real-time updates for active subitems
- **Volume**: ~5000 subitems across all customer schedules
- **Retention**: Full history aligned with parent schedule retention

### Business Rules
- Subitems must belong to valid parent schedule items
- Subitem progress affects parent item completion status
- Dependencies between subitems must be respected
- Resource assignments cannot exceed capacity limits

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Parent Schedule Items → Subitem Management → Progress Tracking
         ↓                     ↓                    ↓
   Monday.com Boards      Dependency Engine    Warehouse Tables
```

### Key Components
1. **Subitem Sync**: Monday.com subitem board integration
2. **Dependency Manager**: Track and enforce subitem dependencies
3. **Progress Calculator**: Aggregate subitem progress to parent items
4. **Resource Tracker**: Monitor resource allocation across subitems
5. **Notification Engine**: Alert on critical path changes

### Database Schema
- `schedule_subitems` - Individual subitem details
- `subitem_dependencies` - Relationships between subitems
- `subitem_progress` - Progress tracking and status updates
- `subitem_resources` - Resource assignments and utilization
- `subitem_history` - Change tracking and audit trail

## Development Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Extend parent schedule data model for subitems
- [ ] Design dependency tracking system
- [ ] Plan progress aggregation algorithms
- [ ] Define resource allocation constraints

### Phase 2: Core Development
- [ ] Implement subitem synchronization from Monday.com
- [ ] Build dependency management and validation
- [ ] Create progress calculation and rollup logic
- [ ] Develop resource allocation tracking

### Phase 3: Business Logic
- [ ] Implement critical path analysis
- [ ] Build progress aggregation to parent items
- [ ] Create resource conflict detection
- [ ] Develop automated status updates

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for dependency logic and progress calculations
- [ ] Integration tests with parent schedule workflow
- [ ] Performance testing with complex dependency chains
- [ ] Business rule validation testing
