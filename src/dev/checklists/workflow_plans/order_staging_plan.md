# Order Staging Workflow Plan

## Overview
The Order Staging workflow processes incoming orders from multiple sources, validates and transforms the data, and stages it for final processing into the production order management system.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development Planning
- **Last Updated**: 2025-06-17
- **Main Script**: `scripts/order_staging/`
- **Dev Location**: `dev/order_staging/`

## Business Requirements

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Receive orders from multiple channels (web, EDI, API, manual entry)
- [ ] Validate order data against business rules and customer constraints
- [ ] Transform orders to standardized format for downstream processing
- [ ] Stage validated orders for production system integration

### Data Requirements
- **Sources**: E-commerce platform, EDI partners, API integrations, manual entry
- **Target**: SQL Server staging tables and production order system
- **Frequency**: Real-time for web orders, batch for EDI (hourly)
- **Volume**: ~500 orders daily, peak of 1000+ during busy periods
- **Retention**: 90 days in staging, permanent in production

### Business Rules
- Customer credit limits must be validated
- Inventory availability must be confirmed
- Order totals must match line item sums
- Delivery dates must respect customer schedules
- Pricing rules and discounts applied correctly

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Multiple Order Sources → Data Validation → Staging Tables → Production System
        ↓                      ↓               ↓              ↓
   Format Detection     Business Rules    Quality Checks   Order Fulfillment
```

### Key Components
1. **Source Adapters**: Handle different input formats (JSON, XML, EDI, CSV)
2. **Data Validator**: Comprehensive validation engine
3. **Business Rules Engine**: Apply customer-specific rules and constraints
4. **Staging Manager**: Manage staging tables and data flow
5. **Integration Bridge**: Connect to production order management system

### Database Schema
- `order_staging_raw` - Incoming orders in original format
- `order_staging_validated` - Orders after validation and transformation
- `order_staging_errors` - Failed orders with error details
- `order_validation_rules` - Configurable business rules
- `order_processing_log` - Audit trail of all processing steps

- [ ] User training and documentation

## Data Sources & Formats

### E-commerce Platform
- **Format**: JSON via REST API
- **Frequency**: Real-time
- **Volume**: ~300 orders daily
- **Key Fields**: Customer ID, items, quantities, pricing, shipping

### EDI Partners
- **Format**: X12 850 Purchase Orders
- **Frequency**: Hourly batch processing
- **Volume**: ~150 orders daily
- **Key Fields**: Partner ID, PO number, line items, delivery requirements

### API Integrations
- **Format**: JSON/XML via webhook or polling
- **Frequency**: Near real-time
- **Volume**: ~50 orders daily
- **Key Fields**: Integration source, order reference, customer data

### Manual Entry
- **Format**: Web form input
- **Frequency**: Ad-hoc
- **Volume**: ~20 orders daily
- **Key Fields**: All standard order fields plus operator ID

## Validation Rules

### Data Quality Validation
- [ ] Required fields completeness check
- [ ] Data format and type validation
- [ ] Field length and range validation
- [ ] Reference data integrity checks

### Business Rule Validation
- [ ] Customer credit limit verification
- [ ] Inventory availability confirmation
- [ ] Pricing and discount rule application
- [ ] Delivery date feasibility check
- [ ] Order minimum/maximum validation

### System Integration Validation
- [ ] Customer exists in master system
- [ ] Products exist and are active
- [ ] Shipping addresses are valid
- [ ] Payment methods are acceptable

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories
1. **Data Format Errors**: Invalid JSON, malformed EDI, missing fields
2. **Business Rule Violations**: Credit limit exceeded, out of stock
3. **System Integration Errors**: Customer not found, product inactive
4. **Processing Errors**: Database connection, transformation failures

### Error Resolution
- **Automatic Retry**: Transient system errors (3 attempts)
- **Manual Review**: Business rule violations requiring human decision
- **Source Notification**: Invalid data format requiring source correction
- **Escalation**: Critical errors affecting multiple orders

## Performance Requirements

### Processing Targets
- **Real-time Orders**: Process within 30 seconds
- **Batch EDI**: Complete hourly batch within 10 minutes
- **Peak Load**: Handle 200 orders/hour during busy periods
- **Error Resolution**: Manual review queue processed within 4 hours

### Scalability Requirements
- Support 150% of current order volume (750+ daily)
- Handle seasonal peaks up to 2000 orders/day
- Maintain performance during system maintenance
- Scale horizontally for processing capacity

## Testing Strategy

### Test Data Requirements
- **Sample Orders**: Representative orders from each source
- **Error Scenarios**: Invalid data for each validation rule
- **Volume Testing**: Large batches for performance validation
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual data combinations

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage on validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: All source systems and downstream connections
- **Performance Tests**: Peak volume and sustained load testing
- **Business Tests**: All business rules and workflows

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: Orders processed per minute
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of orders successfully staged
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of orders requiring manual intervention
- **Queue Depth**: Number of orders awaiting processing

### Alert Conditions
- Processing queue depth > 100 orders
- Error rate > 5% for any source system
- Processing time > 2 minutes for real-time orders
- Integration system unavailable for > 5 minutes

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive customer data (PII, payment info)
- [ ] Implement access controls for staging data
- [ ] Audit all data access and modifications
- [ ] Secure API endpoints and EDI transmissions

### Compliance Requirements
- [ ] PCI DSS compliance for payment data
- [ ] SOX compliance for financial data integrity
- [ ] GDPR compliance for customer data privacy
- [ ] Industry-specific regulations for EDI partners

## Deployment & Rollback

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Development Testing**: Complete dev environment validation
2. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging with production data copy
3. **Limited Production**: Process orders for select customers only
4. **Full Production**: Complete rollout with monitoring

### Rollback Procedures
- **Immediate**: Stop order processing and revert to manual entry
- **Staged**: Rollback specific source systems while maintaining others
- **Complete**: Full system rollback with data preservation
- **Recovery**: Reprocess staged orders after issue resolution

## Future Enhancements
