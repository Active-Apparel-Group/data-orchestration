  file_inventory_analysis: |
    CRITICAL: Comprehensive analysis shows 50+ hardcoded file references that MUST be updated
    to prevent system-wide failures. This is not optional - every reference must be found and updated.
    
  affected_file_patterns:
    utils_config_references: "30+ files reference utils/config.yaml"
    utils_mapping_references: "15+ files reference utils/data_mapping.yaml" 
    utils_json_references: "13+ files reference utils/*.json mapping files"
    sql_ddl_references: "8+ files reference sql/ddl/ paths"
    docs_mapping_references: "12+ files reference docs/mapping/ files"
    queries_references: "5+ files reference queries/ folder"
    
  critical_failure_points:
    - "ALL VS Code tasks will fail if file paths not updated (25+ tasks)"
    - "Configuration loading will fail in 15+ Python scripts"
    - "Template generation will break (5+ template files)"
    - "Documentation links will be broken (20+ markdown files)"
    - "Workflow deployments will fail (3+ Kestra workflows)"
    
  mandatory_update_strategy: |
    This is a SYSTEMATIC operation requiring methodical updates to every single reference.
    No shortcuts - every file must be checked, updated, and validated.
    Failure to update even one critical reference will cause system failures.
