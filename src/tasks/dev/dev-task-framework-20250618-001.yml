# Detailed workflow steps (adapted to our current tools and processes)

    - name: "Initialize project structure"
      manual_step: true
      guidance: |
        1. Copy relevant template from dev/monday-boards-dynamic/ or similar
        2. Set up testing framework following existing patterns
        3. Configure logger_helper.py integration
        4. Set up db_helper.py database connections
  
  development:
    - name: "Implement core features"
      manual_step: true
      guidance: |
        1. Follow established patterns from existing workflows
        2. Use utils/db_helper.py for database operations
        3. Use utils/logger_helper.py for logging
        4. Implement retry logic and error handling
        5. Add TEST_MODE for development testing
        6. Follow zero-downtime patterns for production scripts

      guidance: |
        1. Access Kestra UI
        2. Trigger workflow execution
        3. Monitor logs and validate results
        4. Verify data quality and completeness

# Success criteria (adapted to our current standards)
success_criteria:
  functional:
    - "All acceptance criteria met"

    - "Performance targets met (per workflow_development_checklist.md)"
  
  technical:
    - "Follows established patterns (db_helper, logger_helper, config)"
    - "Production-grade error handling and retry logic"
    - "Comprehensive logging for Kestra monitoring"
    - "TEST_MODE support for development"
  
  operational:

# Integration with our existing tools
integration:
  tools:
    deployment: "tools/deploy-scripts-clean.ps1, tools/deploy-workflows.ps1"
    testing: "pytest, manual validation scripts"
    monitoring: "Kestra UI, workflow logs"
  
  dependencies:
    utils:
      - "utils/db_helper.py"
      - "utils/logger_helper.py" 
      - "utils/config.yaml"
      - "utils/data_mapping.yaml"
    
  makefile_targets:

# Risk management (specific to our environment)
risks:
  - risk: "Database connectivity issues during deployment"
    impact: "high"
    probability: "medium"
    mitigation: "Test db_helper.py connections in dev first"
  
  - risk: "Kestra workflow deployment failure"
    impact: "medium"
    probability: "low"
    mitigation: "Use tools/deploy-workflows.ps1 with validation"
  
  - risk: "Zero-downtime requirement not met"
    impact: "high"
    probability: "low"
    mitigation: "Follow atomic swap patterns from existing workflows"
