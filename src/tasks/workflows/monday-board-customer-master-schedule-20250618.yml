checklist:
  discovery:
    - "[x] Identify Monday.com board ID: 9200517329"

    - "[x] Review existing similar boards for patterns"
    - "[x] Determine update frequency requirements"
    - "[x] Confirm target SQL table naming convention"
  development:
    - "[x] Generate script using universal_board_extractor.py with board ID 9200517329"
    - "[x] Review generated script in dev/monday-boards-dynamic/generated/"
    - "[x] Test script in TEST_MODE with limited data sample"
    - "[x] Validate data types and column mappings"
    - "[x] Verify board_relation columns are auto-rejected"
    - "[x] Test zero-downtime atomic swap functionality"
    - "[x] Validate error handling and retry logic"
  
  testing:
    - "[x] Run data type validator on sample data"
    - "[x] Test with production data volume in TEST_MODE"
    - "[x] Verify SQL DDL generation and table creation"    
    - "[x] Test schema change detection and auto-adaptation"
    - "[x] Validate logging output for Kestra compatibility"
    - "[x] Performance test: confirm <3 minutes per 1000 records"
  
  deployment:
    - "[x] Copy script to scripts/monday-boards/get_board_customer_master_schedule.py"
    - "[x] Create Kestra workflow: workflows/monday-board-customer_master_schedule.yml"
    - "[x] Deploy using tools/deploy-scripts-clean.ps1"
    - "[x] Deploy workflow using tools/deploy-workflows.ps1"
    - "[x] Test end-to-end execution in Kestra environment"
    - "[x] Verify data quality and completeness"
    - "[x] Configure monitoring and alerting"
  
  production:
    - "[x] Schedule production runs in Kestra"
    - "[ ] Monitor first few production runs"
    - "[x] Update DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.md"
    - "[x] Add board to workflow_development_checklist.md as completed"
    - "[x] Archive development files"
    - "[x] Document any lessons learned or edge cases"

# Risk assessment (Monday.com specific)
risks:
  - risk: "Monday.com API rate limiting or timeouts"
    impact: "medium"
    probability: "low"
    mitigation: "Implemented 60s timeout and 3-retry exponential backoff"
  
  - risk: "Board schema changes breaking extraction"
    impact: "high"
    probability: "medium"
    mitigation: "Dynamic schema detection auto-adapts to changes"
  
  - risk: "Large data volume causing performance issues"
    impact: "medium"
    probability: "low"
    mitigation: "Tested with 3000+ records, optimized bulk operations"
  
  - risk: "Database connectivity issues during atomic swap"
    impact: "high"
    probability: "low"
    mitigation: "Atomic swap ensures zero data loss, rollback capability"
