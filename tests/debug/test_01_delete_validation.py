DEBUG: Test 01_delete_null_rows.sql - Prove it does NOT delete GREYSON data
========================================================================

This test validates that 01_delete_null_rows.sql works correctly and does NOT delete 
our GREYSON PO 4755 test data (69 records).

Purpose: Prove the deletion step is not the root cause of the Enhanced Merge Orchestrator issue.
